They include identifying what’s at risk and how it’s at risk.\n\nSo far, so good. But the next step is prioritizing the threats and allocating mitigation resources based on those priorities. The problem I have with this bill is I have not seen any but the most anecdotal evidence suggesting there is any sort of significant risk from vote-by-mail.

The bill's requirement for government-issued photo identification disenfranchise eligible voters who lack such documentation, effectively suppressing their right to vote. Oregon's vote-by-mail system has a proven track record of enhancing voter turnout and ensuring electoral integrity; dismantling it in favor of in-person voting lacks justification and undermines decades of successful practice. The proposed changes could lead to increased administrative costs and logistical challenges, straining county resources and potentially causing confusion among voters. Maintaining the current vote-by-mail system preserves accessibility, convenience, and the democratic principle of inclusive participation for all eligible Oregonians.	3	\N	2025-04-01 06:13:44.223051+00	2025-04-01 06:30:21.662876+00	2025-03-31 22:06:47+00	f	mkre9bz

If you are willing to leave on good terms and establish a payment plan for unpaid rent, they may be willing to work with you. An eviction isn’t desirable for either of you. And as sad as it is, you need to rehome those cats. You cannot afford to give them the life they deserve. And frankly when this is your living scenario you should not be putting money towards anything except housing stability.	157	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.006409+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.006409+00	2025-03-31 14:00:07+00	f	mkoptjk

There they will give you a few options. 1) there will be representatives there from rent assistance programs that are income based and you can apply which will postpone the eviction until you receive an approval or not from those programs. 2) they will give you the option to voluntarily vacate the property (this will not be an eviction on your record but past rent will still be owed to the landlord and you can set up payments with them) or 3) your landlord may allow you to make payments to stay within the property. But make sure you attend the first trial because if you don’t they will rule in favor of the property owner and you will be removed that day.	15	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.012251+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.012251+00	2025-03-31 22:23:52+00	f	mkrha4o

I know someone else they are paying rent for because them becoming homeless will make their mental/health much worse. I'd look into that especially based on what you said here. You would start by calling your health home/ care coordinator. \n\nYou can file for unemployment because you've been available to work but nfoodiven many shifts.

Take all the legal help you can get, take a deep breath, and start looking for jobs because the one you're at is obviously not cutting it. \n\nIt's going to be ok. You need more support than you have right now, but you *will* get through this. I was really depressed and unemployed for a while- I was essentially spending all day doing .. frankly, pretty demeaning art to make ends meet. \n\nIt felt impossible to get out of that hole. I was living with family, super obese, I spent all day mentally berating myself, and I just kept spiralling further into food addiction and self hate. But, one day, I reached out for help at Old Town Clinic. I got treatment for my mental health, and I started actually being able to function and make healthier choices. I was still isolated, but I started making online friends. I started feeling better physically, and I found I had energy to get to the job hunt. I landed a job, then I found a DnD group, got my own place, and I'm building up a social network, slowly but surely. I got promoted at work. Life isn't perfect, but an upward spiral started and I'm holding on for dear life. This all happened to me over the course of about 8 months. I hope it helps to read this, at least a little.	20	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.018373+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.018373+00	2025-03-31 16:15:27+00	f	mkpgej9

I think the most important thing for you is to maintain perspective so you can tackle the challenges you need to face. These are very solvable, trust.\n\nYou are way too young &amp; this is way too small a problem to even consider yourself a failure, let alone ponder self-harm. It can be difficult to see that clearly when you're in the thick of it but I promise you can come back from this quite easily.\n\nHere's some context to understand my point:\n\n* the average American carries over $50k debt personally\n* the average household carries over $105k debt\n\nSo, compared to the average American you're financially in better shape. You have an urgent need to address, sure, but overall things aren't as bleak as they may seem.\n\nYour rent is quite low for Portland so trying to work something out to stay put is probably your best option. Since you have $2k you can offer to pay April and May upfront, plus a longer term plan to repay your unpaid rent over time. Before you send any cash though, make sure you get whatever plan you agree to in writing signed by both you and your landlord. If you need help wording this in a letter just ask.\n\nTo make good on that commitment, and generally to make it as an adult, you need to find a reliable source of income so start looking for another job to add to your current one or replace it. The minimum wage in Portland is around $16 per hour and the city is quite commutable without a car, so you can cover your living expenses with literally any full time job.\n\nGood luck &amp; keep your head up!	2	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.025331+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.025331+00	2025-03-31 23:50:21+00	f	mkrwcxb

I know you are drowning right now and everything probably feels impossible, but things will get better. Hang in there!\n\nI'm hoping some of the resources people posted can help you. But just a word of caution: be careful. There are slimy people out there who will take adantage of you because they know you need to escape a bad situation.\n\nAlso - can you find a grief support group? Maybe one that meets on Zoom calls? Being around people who understand what you are going through and support you will make you feel understood/heard and that is *so* important. If you search for "grief support group Oregon" you can find many options.\n\nFinal note: if you need pragmatic help doing small things like editing your resume, I could help with that (ChatGPT is honestly pretty good too). Are you looking for jobs in Portland? Or are you in a space where that's not even on your radar right now? When I've felt hopelessly behind/overwhelmed by life, often the best thing I can do is pick one small thing and accomplish it. Check out Tiny Habits by Dr. Fogg. He has a free program where he will get on phone calls with you and sometimes just hearing a friendly / supportive voice can be good (same goes for grief support group!).	13	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.800747+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.800747+00	2025-04-10 16:53:19+00	f	mmezv9h

This is devastating. I created a loose “grief gang” group for people who are experiencing loss, the discord link is: https://discord.gg/Z8NC66Nh\n\nThe group is Portland/Vancouver based, and I know there are people in transitional housing situations that may have a place for you or resources that can help. I don’t have housing suggestions, but myself (and others in the grief gang I’m sure) could help you move. At the very least, it’s a safe space to vent about all of this and meet some friends locally who feel safe. \n\nPeople in Portland are so friendly and understanding.

If you find a place and need starting supplies, Dm me if you need an air mattress I can give one along with sheets comforter pillows and extra storage furniture for a bedroom. I don’t have reliable space though as I’m moving. I can give food as well  to help with the transition.	6	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.812824+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.812824+00	2025-04-10 17:40:05+00	f	mmf9l23

Especially live in care giver or those work programs. I also suggest calling Homeforward and talking to them about your options. They're a low income/housing kinda help program most of portland area/s section 8/hud housing programs use.\n\n  \nIf you need help with resume reach out to me, I'll gladly help build you one to use to apply for jobs. If you just want a friend in the area to talk to and we can go on walks just to get out please reach out. Grief is hard on your own in a new area and not having friends can be rough.	3	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.814733+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.814733+00	2025-04-10 17:01:42+00	f	mmf1l9g

Gives you a chance to same up and make plans. Also it's good healthy work. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure what is out there at the moment though.

First, I am so sorry for what you're going through, I can't imagine losing my partner and being in this world, at this time, especially queer, alone. \nMy partner and I are new to Portland. As much as I wish I had stable housing to potentially offer you, or even great resources, I don't. \nI can offer you a shoulder to lean on. You're welcome to message me any time for any reason. I am in my early 30s, female, and queer.  I am "Cali sober."(I use cannabis, but currently, my financial situation doesn't allow for that). \nI hope that you find somewhere safe, or at least some good resources.  I'm sure some people on this thread will have those for you.\nHang in there.\nYou're NOT alone. Things will get better if you work at it.	12	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.818849+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.818849+00	2025-04-10 14:30:51+00	f	mme6zyx

I dread facing the same, or leaving my partner to do so, so I feel for you. I don't have the resources to share with you, as far as places I know are safe, but Portland should have resources (off the top of my head Street Roots is the only example I can offer).\n\nKeep your head up, because you can absolutely make it through this, even if it's the hardest thing you've ever faced. I know you can. Keep that fire burning, and don't let anyone take it from you.	3	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.826577+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.826577+00	2025-04-10 14:15:58+00	f	mme414x

Grief is such a difficult thing, and to be dealing with it on top of an inadequate support network is that much worse. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and ongoing difficulties. \n\nThings can get better, and I'm sure you know this, time helps but only as much as you let it. \n\nI'm glad you are reaching out.  Do you hope to land in Portland or are you wanting somewhere more rural? What kind of work are you hoping to move into? Do you have a car?\n\n Do you have any hobbies or sports you play? Perhaps getting involved in one of those communities locally can help you get out of your dad's house more.\n\nThere are some online education resources that could help you get a certificate to be better qualified for certain jobs, that could be something to focus on while finding safe housing. I think most can be done with a phone. If you're interested in that DM me and I'll help you out. I would love to offer you a place to stay but I'm in transition right now myself and am not able to currently. \n\n\nMostly I just want to feed you and hug you. But I can't so I've tried to offer some tips. I really feel for you and hope you get what you need.	2	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.828609+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.828609+00	2025-04-10 17:51:53+00	f	mmfc2mi

There are people living here who were convinced the entirety of Portland was burning because of "riots and lawlessness on the streets" because Fox news was running with that 24/7 for a while. I had patients who wouldn't be convinced otherwise, and I'm like "I live in Portland...do I look like I'm on fire right now?"\n\nSo now we're back to Portland being vilified on the news and the cycle continues.\n\nPortland really is a nice city with lots to do, and the surrounding areas are amazing for outdoorsy people.\n\nPeople hating on Portland is like people hating on the Midwest, you know? Calling all the Midwest "flyover Monsanto states with nothing but corn and cow shit".

I do it all the time. Mornings are a straight 45, pretty easy. It's the curves on the way home that can drag and cause delays.

I had a 36 mile commute once in my life and I'd never do it again. One accident, a little ice, someone getting pulled over, etc and your commute time multiplies. I'd much rather commute for fun than work. If the weather is bad, you're probably not going out anyways. If you do it, maybe pick a town in-between but then you're not close to anything. There is differing cost of living as well. A quick search says the COL is 17% higher in Portland. Your gas and car wear &amp; tear is higher. You shouldn't consider your time free (4 extra hours per week in your car). Your pay will remain the same since you're keeping your job.

Then it went to 3 days and I started looking for a job up here because that was too much for me. \n\nIf you do decide to do it, you want to get a place that is very close to the HWY ramp as it will really make the commute much faster. So SE close to 205 or downtown/SW close to I5.	2	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.192524+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.192524+00	2025-04-27 04:43:12+00	f	mp9jmbm

Honestly, it is an easy commute. Traffic is significantly heavier the other direction. The morning drive is 55 minutes and the afternoon 1hr15-1hr30. \n\nDepending on where in Portland you live will matter for sure. I've got an easy hop over the Hawthorne and boom I5 in a jiffy. I always skip the risk of a train on 11th. If I were on the westside the drive would be marginally easier but only maybe. North Portland would make things slightly worse but not a horrible drive either.	4	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.200203+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.200203+00	2025-04-27 00:16:46+00	f	mp8ggwd

I lived by the airport and I drive to South Salem to take care of my grandma with dementia. I take her grocery shopping. Sometimes it takes me three hours to get to Salem and get home at night. It’s better to drive like late. Late at night don’t even try to drive between 6 AM and 10 AM. Or anytime between 2 PM and 6 PM because you will definitely be in the car for four hours.

There’s usually no traffic, occasionally you hit it on the way back into pdx around the curves but even that is rare. If you don’t mind listening to podcasts and spending lots of money on gas plus car maintenance it’s not bad! It works for me since I have a lot of friends up here in Portland and I like the city so much. If you don’t have ties to the city or its many amenities it’s probably not worth it.\n\nIf you do decide to do it make sure you get a safe, reliable, and high mpg car. Something like a Prius where you get close to 50mpg and won’t have to fix it a bunch. I started off doing it in a Subaru and spent about $500 a month on gas. Prius would be about $200. Also the winters can be wacky, the drive there is fine but the way back in the dark with heavy rain can be exhausting when you do it everyday	1	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.220568+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.220568+00	2025-04-27 18:33:03+00	f	mpcrij1

It’s a straight shot down I5, for me less than 40 minutes in the morning and 50 minutes tops coming home in the afternoon (my place of work in Salem is directly off the Portland road exit). We moved to SE off of Powell a couple years ago, not quite as doable from this side of town and am looking for a job up here. \n\nI also lived in Salem before moving to SW 4 years ago, and I would say if you’re able to find something in SW Portland, the commute is well worth the opportunities of living in Portland over Salem.	1	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.22303+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.22303+00	2025-04-27 19:09:15+00	f	mpcyj0h

All my good luck to you.\n\nThey’re crepuscular, so evening or early morning may be the best times to cross paths. If Simon is not familiar with the outdoors, you’re likely to find him very close to your place, but well hidden. They get spooked being without their usual environment and will likely hide. Check all the little crannies you can. Mine was found playing in a box literally the next building over, but was gone for days. He never responded to my calls, despite being a gregarious and social cat. If you have chill neighbors, maybe give them a heads up that you’ll be patrolling the ‘hood for a cat so they don’t call the cops on you (ask me how I know.) If you sit outside in the quieter times (we did this in the late evening) and just talk casually with someone, he may come to the sound of your voice. Leaving litter out seems to be advocated by some and not advocated by others. He may smell himself and come to it, but it can also attract other animals, which could serve to keep him away from it. That’s all the lost-cat brain dump I can recall at the moment, but I’ll come back if I remember more.\n\nHoping Simon is home ASAP! He’s a beautiful cat.	2	\N	2025-04-28 00:16:50.603816+00	2025-04-28 02:41:45.654937+00	2025-04-27 18:31:30+00	f	mpcr7x4

For years it's well known to be the biggest tourist trap in the state by many. Downtown is where you're supposed to go. However, it's only for tourists and employees from the suburbs. We actually have neighborhoods/districts where the real locals go. Honestly, the only real reason to go there is because of Powell's, Pioneer Square, and OMSI. Chinatown isn't what you think it is. It's not a real Chinatown. It's where our meth clinics are. Anything that used to be Chinese is ran down and closed except 2 things. People only say otherwise because we're desperate for people to go back. Downtown.

Tourists don't have to deal with a school system that's ineffective and losing students to the suburbs, and facing massive cuts in the near future. Tourists don't have to worry about the near impossibility of building housing due to an insanely expensive and slow permitting system. Tourists don't have the worry about the some of the highest income taxes in the nation.

Riding in someone’s draft requires about 20% less power, more so if it’s windy or you’re in a large group. It’s *way* easier. \n\nDid you eat? You say you drank electrolytes, but you need to be consuming 60-90g of carbs per hour on rides over ~75 minutes. \n\nTry some group rides. Lakeside and West End have weekly rides; there’s also the lawyer ride and Sauvie Shootout. Or sign up for a race - the Novice category at PIR is a fantastic intro to group riding and you’ll meet some cool people too.	4	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.675675+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.675675+00	2025-04-27 04:37:02+00	f	mp9ivfe

If you want to do it in two days, you put your bag on the truck going to the place where you want to stop for the night. If you’re not sure if you can do the full 200, bring a bag and put it on a truck for the stop you can definitely make it to.

I did it with a group of friends and our goal was to average 20 mph, which we achieved. \n\nI never focused on being in any specific zone for my STP training rides, and if I were to, it would definitely not be zone 4. It's more important to focus on increasing frequency and volume, ultimately increasing endurance.\n\nAssuming you have the time, I liked doing back to back long rides on weekends. Maybe you do a sixty mile group ride Saturday, on Sunday I would do another ride of equal or longer distance with some friends. But this is something you will have to scale up to, it can't be done just out of the gates.\n\nAt the end of the day, focus on riding more. Increase the number of days you ride and mileage. FWIW, I average 200mpw last time I did STP, that was more than enough. I'm sure my friends were closer to 125 to 150mpw. Don't worry about the zones so much.	3	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.709937+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.709937+00	2025-04-27 04:58:52+00	f	mp9lhjh

Reach the Beach\n2. Salem century (I can’t remember the name)\n3. Columbia county century challenge (the most climbing)\n\nIf you do these and then the STP you’ll be fine. It’s 5,000 ft over 200 miles. \n\nYou need to drink and eat early and often. \n\nDid it once, 18mph with husband. Glad I did it but won’t do it again\n\nAlso, pro move: Have a bike friend meet you in St Helens and pull you in to Portland. Fresh legs against a headwind and the dirty 30 is always the way to go.	3	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.726146+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.726146+00	2025-04-27 05:31:26+00	f	mp9p54z

But, a few ideas: \n\nAbsolutely best advice I can give is get an indoor smart trainer and sign up for TrainerRoad or Xert or one of the other coaching programs. There is just enough time to get you ready. I almost exclusively train indoors for centuries and other endurance rides. But, that’s also a lot less fun than being outside. \n\nBeside that: \n\n16.2 average for 60 miles is a good starting place! You have time to get ready, but it’s going to be a not fun day. \n\nDrafting/pace lines make a HUGE difference. But you can’t just do them. Your inexperience will be identified quickly. Unless you find a patient group to let you learn on the fly. It does happen, but it’s more likely you will piss people off or be dangerous to them. \n\nI’d suggest you think about your training differently. Intensity is a tool, use it, but don’t abuse it. It burns you out fast, both during a ride and as it accumulates over the weeks. If your weekends are your opportunity, I’d do 60-90 minutes of intensity on Saturday and something much longer and slower on Sunday. Maybe add ten miles a week every Sunday. But it shouldn’t be a race. Log good, solid, miles, methodically.\n\nIf you can pull it off, an hour of intensity during the week and an hour or two of something like zone two on another day would be ideal. You need saddle time to get your ass ready to be on a bike seat for 12 hours. \n\nTrack your miles. Over let’s say four to five weeks your weekly total should be going up. After those four to five, take a recovery week. And then get back at it until a week before STP and use that as a recovery week.\n\nThere are good podcasts about fueling and hydration. I’d start looking for those. \n\nCycling is the best because all you really need is determination. Good luck!!\n\nOh, you may also want to try an organized 100 mile ride before STP. It will be great training AND you can see if you like it enough to do something twice as long.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.733926+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.733926+00	2025-04-27 04:56:44+00	f	mp9l8lo

STP also generally has modest tail winds and modest grades for most of the route making it some of the lowest effort per mile riding.  All that said, it is still 200 miles, so get in some century days, practice eating and drinking properly.  Expect a lot of sun and heat, with 90’s being the norm for the last two years when I rode it.  Consider setting up your bike to handle eating and drinking on the bike such that you can skip some rest stops where it is easy to waste a lot of time.  I was stopping every 50 or so miles thanks to a frame bag with a couple of liters in a bladder and a ready supply of snacks.  I also wore a Da Brim to help with the sun load and would do the same if I rode it again.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.740323+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.740323+00	2025-04-27 07:45:04+00	f	mpa2r6q

I was in a similar spot to you when I did it in two days. I trained by commuting full time and then SPINNING from Pier Park to Troutdale, and back, every weekend for months. The two day was still very tough. I hit a wall just before Centralia. My wife and son were meeting me in our small camper van. I ate dinner with them at the carts provided by STP and saw all these really tiny people eating enormous meals. I just ate a normal portion and felt kind of nauseous afterwards. I went and chilled at the camper, which we parked in a spot where we could cheer on the late arrivals. After hanging for about 90 minutes I told my wife and son I was going for a second dinner. After round two the nausea went away and I started feeling good. Day two was a blast but it wouldn’t have been possible for me without a huge dinner and a full night of rest. I think it would have sucked to miss the overnight stop in Centralia and the party at the end in Portland on Sunday. Do it in two days. If it’s a gear issue there are solutions to that problem available.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.745609+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.745609+00	2025-04-27 15:16:27+00	f	mpbou7q

I recommend biking out to St. Helens and back, maybe with a friend, to get a better idea of your speed on flats. If you're stopping more than once an hour -- or drinking more than 2 bottles an hour -- that may be something to check into. As others have mentioned drafting saves you 30% or more watts. In a big pack, it's more. You should definitely practice. Pull through. Learn to ride with others. Learn the signals, etc. Also, and most importantly, get ready to embrace the suck.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.750776+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.750776+00	2025-04-27 21:50:20+00	f	mpdtejz

We ended up driving all the way down to Depoe Bay instead hoping for a whale sighting (didn’t see any but late lunch at Tidal Raves was great). \n\nIn Cannon Beach, we stayed overnight at the Hallmark Resort and had a cozy room with a fireplace and a panoramic view of the beach.

First part of the trip you should go up into Astoria and down into cannon. Use 26 to comeback. I’d recommend after cannon going to manzanita. Tons of look outs on the way there. Then you take 53 from Nehalem to get to 26 and go back. Trust me\n\nEdit: I live here I know what I am talking about lol\n\nOr extend the drive down check out Oceanside theres a cool cave on the beach.

Just walking down Broadway street to the promenade is cute, classic tourist beach town vibes.\n\nThen I would recommend stopping at the pronto pup place in Rockaway beach. \n\nIn tillamook there is a place called blue heron French cheese company that is cuter than the tillamook cheese factory. The blue heron place has farm animals out front and multiple cute little stores/gift shops with fancy cheese, chocolate and snacks! \n\nIn Newport NYE beach, the aquarium, and the marine science center! Plus downtown Newport is fun to walk through as well, they have cute shops/restaurants and you can see the sea lions. \n\nBetween Newport and Waldport there is a restaurant called Luna sea fish house in Seal Rock which has really good food (a bit pricey though).	2	\N	2025-04-28 06:17:58.819207+00	2025-04-28 06:17:58.819207+00	2025-04-27 17:29:02+00	f	mpceqse

Coastline - north or south coasts (further north is colder and windier but more rugged). Desert city with four season weather with trees and plateaus - Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Sisters). High desert with higher mountains - Eastern Oregon (La Grande, Pendleton, Burns). More greenery with more rain and more population - Willamette Valley (Portland, Salem, Eugene). Still green with more mountains and less population - Southern Oregon (Roseburg, Medford, Grants Pass)…. Plus, so many other amazing cities/towns (Crater Lake, Mt Hood, Mt Bachelor, Shakespeare Festival, Kite Festivals, rock hunting, gold panning, skiing, hiking, mountain biking……) and options to visit/live that would fill up books. If you go to the State of Oregon Visitor’s website, they have all kinds of videos and data of the state. It has pretty much anything you would want to know about. Hope that helps.

Not sure where they are at with that, not much hope in the Forest Service doing anything meaningful for at least the next four years.\n\nThe issue with broom and Gorse really is the seed bank.

As far as passable, those 2 routes are not as maintained like you would expect a pass to be but they lay lava rock on the roads to help with traction.

I can't afford to spend that much time on public transit. It can easily take three or four times as long once you figure in transfer times. I also don't like dealing with the bad smells and unstable people on the train, but that is a lower priority for me than the amount of time. I don't like how dirty everything feels on our public transit and miss the cleaner buses we had during the pandemic. The closest transit to me is Lombard and Interstate. I see people fucking, pissing, and shitting there at 2AM. Someone is always doing drugs or just being a creep around this intersection regardless of time. I just can't deal with that before or after a ten hour shift. I don't have it in me.	52	\N	2025-04-28 02:13:14.70509+00	2025-04-28 06:27:01.575835+00	2025-04-27 18:54:02+00	f	mpcvl76

Here’s the dets, Sesame Donuts is located around 39th/Ceasar Chavez and Powell, same side as the Safeway but a bit east. Their devils food donuts are slap me amazing. Not the chocolate, you can get one of those to compare with the devils food, but there is no comparison. \nNext try Heavenly Donuts. At least 3 locations in Portland and one in Milwaukie. These are hood approved (Portland does NOT have any hood anything, but ?). Try their fritters; apple, raspberry or pineapple. Their old fashioned donuts are also tasty. \nLast one and I can’t remember the name is on Sandy in NE across from a Safeway. Also good. \nNow! I want a donut.

I'm not sure if he was neurodivergent, or if he didn't know much English or what his reasoning for saying it so much was, but he clearly had a lot of empathy and he was kind, he even offered me some candy one day and he liked giving people hugs.\n\nHe was so nice that I actually worried about him downtown, I knew that people got taken advantage of on the streets a lot, especially if they had a disability and this guy wasn't a big guy either, he could easily get snapped like a twig if someone decided to fuck with him, I really hope nothing bad happened to him.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:28:23.953062+00	2025-04-28 06:28:23.953062+00	2025-04-28 06:05:04+00	f	mpfw0zu

Both of them spoke better Chinese than I ever did during our four years together.	3	\N	2025-04-28 06:29:05.89562+00	2025-04-28 06:29:05.89562+00	2025-04-28 03:23:59+00	f	mpfchgx

Are you good in a fast paceline to get a workout in? Are you looking to adventure ride? Are you looking to ride around with a theme or something?   Do you want to find someone to hit up flow trails and jump lines? \n\nSomeone will post shift2bikes which is a ride calendar that is very social ride heavy.  OMTM (our mother the mountain) will post rides on discord or email but they aren't as much "group rides" as "group routes".  Seltzer group is similar. There are a couple local teams that do team rides, and a few clubs (portland velo, etc) do a big saturday ride out of hillsborough.  A few shops lead rides, but they are far and few between, and rarely have a big group with multiple skill levels.	15	\N	2025-04-29 16:07:44.009721+00	2025-04-29 16:07:44.009721+00	2025-04-28 20:09:43+00	f	mpjhkp2

I’m partial to [Thursday Night Ride](https://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-21179), which has met every single week for a full decade, with [Friday Night Ride](https://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-21247) as another weekly option. If you’re looking for something a bit mellower, [Mellow Monday](https://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-20975) is just one of many rides put on by [NakedHearts:PDX](https://www.instagram.com/nakedhearts.pdx).\n\nIt’s not necessarily a ride, but rides sometimes start from [BikePortland’s Happy Hour](https://bikeportland.org/bikehappyhour) every Wednesday afternoon, which is a great place to have a drink and talk with other bike riders.\n\nHope to see you out on a ride soon!	10	\N	2025-04-29 16:07:44.032439+00	2025-04-29 16:07:44.032439+00	2025-04-28 20:40:39+00	f	mpjntfr

The annual permits are valid for a calendar year and expire on December 31st of the year purchased. 7-day permits are valid for the 7 days starting the date of purchase.\n\n(Youth 13 or younger are exempt and are not required have a permit. When a youth turns 14, then a permit is required.)\n\nSUPs/Stand-up paddle boards are considered boats for the purpose of these requirements. So if the stand-up paddle board is 10 feet or longer, the operator would need to have a permit, life jacket, and whistle... \n\nA Wearable Life Jacket ( can be within reach ) \n\nSailboats less than 16 feet in length and all paddlecraft (canoes, kayaks, stand up paddleboards, etc.) need to carry properly-fitting, U.S. Coast Guard -approved wearable life jacket(s) for each person on board and the life jacket must be readily accessible.

The OSP has several different branches.  They aren't just road cops.   Here, the ones I am most familiar with are from the Fish and Wildlife division.   We are on a near first name basis with the local Fish Cop.   They most likely have other divisions as well, I'm just too lazy to look them up.\n\n  \nDutch Bros. are like Nickelback at this point.

I never got why it was so cool, the baristas are annoying and you can’t even get drip coffee. But whatever, it’s cool seeing a small town coffee cart have so much success, so whatever. The owner has done a lot for the community in Grants Pass. \n\nWell, they went public. Headquarters moved to Arizona. Some good friends of mine who started working for Dutch Bros when it was a tiny place got screwed. They were Grants Pass kids who put in 20 years helping Dutch Bros grow to what it is now, and a lot of them got told “move to Arizona or get a new job”. So most of them got new jobs. Most of their jobs could have been done remotely anyway. So, I pretty much say fuck Dutch bros	14	\N	2025-04-29 16:18:14.246867+00	2025-04-29 16:18:14.246867+00	2025-04-29 00:33:53+00	f	mpktk1q

When they said they would not leave because they still had questions about how the school planned to respond to their son’s experience, Rast called 911, asking for the police to come. The report of the incident from the Portland Police Bureau states that they were called in due to “parents yelling at the employees and refusing to leave.”\n\n&gt; “You have to understand that a Black man having the cops called on him is a totally different implication,” Phillips said. “It’s a complete abuse of power, a ‘Look what I have over you.’”\n\nAnd what follows is a whole load of he said she said, and excuse me if I’m not sympathetic to any more of this sort of bullshit.

It's possible that the child was subjected to a racist slur and the parents behaved terribly with the principal. These are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSorry, but you don't get to play the race card when you have been asked to leave a place by the person in charge and then refuse to leave. That was absolutely crossing a line. White, black, or green, the cops are getting called when you're essentially trespassing.\n\nThe principal saying "all the kids involved denied it" is shocking and reeks of this being swept under the rug. This is shameful.\n\nEDIT: Why the downvotes? Regardless of your color, when you get asked to leave you have to leave. I'm not saying it was right to ask them to leave. The police didn't come or get called because of the color of their skin. FYI, I am dark skinned, especially in the summer. I have (and do) experience racism, especially in the years right after 9/11.

Everyone in my group prefers to march, it’s easier for me to convince people to come to marches. If some people come to the beginning of marches but don’t want to march, so be it, but standing around in the hot sun, not able to even hear the speaker kind of sucks. I’ll still show up but I’d rather march and I think marches will bring larger crowds.	3	\N	2025-05-03 23:43:29.668209+00	2025-05-04 01:17:32.752672+00	2025-05-03 21:36:41+00	f	mqfsbmr

White liberal/leftists "meaning well" but being performative, making it very obvious they don't hang w Black people or know anything about Blackness besides media they consume and maybe some education on why racism is bad. It can be jarring. Example: Day 1 of job my boss couldn't think of anything to play and she said "oh I know something you'll love!" And puts on Lizzo, smiling proudly as if patting herself on the back for being so inclusive, looking at me expectantly to affirm her song choice . Yes, I'm a chubby, Black woman - No, I don't actually listen to Lizzo. It's a lot of stuff like that. I prefer the blatant racism to the weird undertones, BUT there is a lot of great people here and it's miles better than anywhere in the South for trans people and as long as you can handle the weird white leftist racism, it's pretty chill. Beautiful state and there are still lots of normal people here. I only mention the weird different type of racism because came from a small town and didn't recognize it for a bit/ couldn't put a pin on why it made me so uncomfortable. Warning: if you get your hair done.....find a cheap person in Black Portland FB group before you get here ...because the Black hair stylists that come up on your search charge LIKE A MFFFFF ($275 for knotless $150 silk press, etc) Good luck if you do come!

Hillsboro was voted the best place to live in the country. It’s very diverse. Portland is a great example of Neo Liberalism. Everyone talks, rarely do we see people walk. A lot of finger pointing at what the “problem” is. Portland communities are burned out so bad - and I have empathy, but man… we could all do something about it if we stopped fighting each other.\n\nI decided I don’t want to play Portland games. We moved SW, Beaverton is not my jam. But man, Hillsboro is just the best. My wife is from east Africa, and she has called Hillsboro a home away from home. We love it here, no intentions to move. \n\nAll that to say, please do some research so you don’t end up making a mistake. My wife loved Portland but she felt very isolated. Then I showed her out here. She really feels like she can just be. Go where you’re welcome and there’s peace. \n\nGood food, things to do, we have a little concert area for upcoming artists nearby in Forest Grove. Not to mention… the PNW and all the greenery. \n\nJust think about it, fast paced and out of touch white people who want you to teach and absolve them of their own shit. Or just regular rural adjacent city,  where it feels less upright, more community, more kinship, and a lot of fun. Hillsboro is really about community.	3	\N	2025-04-29 16:19:13.357852+00	2025-04-30 00:13:36.829755+00	2025-04-29 06:31:03+00	f	mpm9mb1

So you will have allies. There’s tons of LGBTQ and neurodivergent people. It’s very “come as you are”, which I love having also grown up in the South. It’s an introverted bunch, so you’ll have to work a bit and be proactive. The dark and drear can be hard for some or something you love. There’s a lot of beauty and culture and community if you poke around. N &amp; NE Portland will give you more diversity.

I met this dude at a thrift store. I think it was past 82nd on division or Powell or something. It was a store that was full of weird junk. Like old dusty dolls in plastic bags and stuff. He was tall, very thin. Wore a black suit that he was swimming in and a black hat. Looked like a reservoir dogs suit but the whole affect made him look like an evil preacher in a southern gothic movie. He was just emanating confidence and evil. \n\nThere is no way anyone would ever shop at this store. It was such an obvious front that if it were in a movie you wouldn’t believe it.\n\nHe had a guy with him that I can only call his henchman. He barked orders to him and was verbally abusive to the guy. The place was like a mob headquarters. He had me sign some papers and then met me at the lot. It was by the airport and filled with what were obviously stolen mostly luxury cars. I felt a chill and I knew I had made a mistake. \n\nI spoke with a tow truck driver I knew and told him I was putting my truck in the lot and he told me that I needed to cancel the contract and get my truck back. He said it was indeed a place where stolen cars are stored before they’re shipped overseas.

Sometimes there are a few patrons sipping beers and playing video lottery, once I saw a couple guys trying to chat up the dancer. And she never dances.

Modern day Portland isn't returning to the grittiness of the old Portland, but is simply crushing under its weight of super high cost of living. Old Portland used to be dirt cheap, because it was kind of a cruddy place to live. Then, it got better and everyone showed up and it got super expensive - and it remains super expensive. If the cost of living wasn't so terrible, the social ills would not be as dramatic. Homelessness is fundamentally a failure in housing costs.	232	\N	2025-04-29 16:21:43.275014+00	2025-04-29 16:21:43.275014+00	2025-04-28 19:25:29+00	f	mpj8u3v

Division St was dive bars, strip clubs, and porno shops.  As was Bellmont.  And there were winos and homeless all over Old Town.  I remember businesses would put drip sprinkler lines on the walls outside their businesses in Old Town to keep the pavement wet and drive away homeless so they wouldn't sleep on the street.  Union (before it became MLK) and Grand and other major streets on the east side were all but boarded up.\n\nOh, and there were these Guardian Angels vigilantes patrolling the buses and downtown streets because the crime rate was about double what it is today.  Parking your car on the street was always a risk.  You had to club your steering wheel and make sure you pulled out your stereo or at least took the faceplate off.  Or you'd come back to a broken window and pulled stereo.\n\nPlus the cops were racist as hell and caught doing things like throwing dead possums onto the doorsteps of Black-owned businesses.\n\nThere wasn't as many visible homeless tents on traffic medians and such.  But then Old Town was full of rat-infested decaying SRO hotels that smelled of piss and vomit.\n\nOf course you could rent a room in any of a bazillion shared houses all over SE for maybe $200/month.	19	\N	2025-04-29 16:21:43.285943+00	2025-04-29 16:21:43.285943+00	2025-04-28 21:35:12+00	f	mpjyc59

Most tech companies have done layoffs or closed offices locally. Portland is reverting back to its low-income working-class roots, although the cost of living isn’t.

Back then (oh god, grandpa alert) you would see plenty of empty storefronts, or ones filled with random crap. And it seems similar now. I gather that kind of thing was a lot rarer ten years ago.\n\nAlso perhaps it's a recent development, but the unhoused situation downtown now vs 2003-2005 seems actually better now weirdly than back then (I know they all just got punted to the east side).\n\nI'm specifically talking through the lense of downtown.\n\nPS I hadn't been back in years and I had heard a lot about the demise of things yada yada.

So I get that my perspective has changed. \n\nWhat I mostly kind of resent is people acting like Portland was some paradise when it was this gentrified, soulless place for scenesters. And now that they have to see a homeless person, the world is ending, and Portland is over. \n\nI was here when meth was flowing, bars were everywhere downtown, and they handed out clean needles with tickets at shows.

No photos or written records of that time, so we're back to ancient oral tradtion and myths.\n\nJokes aside, the 70s weren't really that long ago. People seem to think that the 70s was how the city "should be" and has always been. But it was really a unique era in its own right, as the wartime boom was finished and many people were suddenly moving out of the city due to rising crime in expanded suburbs, leading to a glut of cheap housing in the city center. Lots of American cities had this. It was never like that before, and probably won't ever be again. It's not natural to expect a large craftsman house at low cost right in the middle of a city.\n\n  \neverything else that people miss like cheap drinks, cheap food, cheap/quirky artistic spaces etc is all downstream of having cheap rent.	1	\N	2025-04-29 16:21:43.46507+00	2025-04-29 16:21:43.46507+00	2025-04-29 04:54:18+00	f	mplyk25

There was new development going on everywhere, the art and food scenes were booming, those old vacant lots were getting bought up and filled, and bands that a few years before had been playing free shows at the 17 Nautical Miles were getting serious radio play. It had been happening for a while, but it definitely hit a “quickening” effect right around then and went parabolic. Those glory days of 10 - 15 years ago that people think about so fondly about were kind of an anomaly.\n\nIt’s something to aspire to again, but people need to remember that this shit is always cyclical.	1	\N	2025-04-29 16:21:43.469634+00	2025-04-29 16:21:43.469634+00	2025-04-29 05:39:46+00	f	mpm43m5

The first I was a transplant from the Midwest that came to PDX in 2012 for an arts job. (Cards on the table I was in LA for a year and a half before that but that was because I was following a partner, not for a job. Also, I like LA. Don't hate.) I had been to PDX many times before that and had friends that lived here. \n\nPDX reminded me so much of Duluth, MN where I lived my entire 20s and had a bit of Minneapolis Uptown vibe to it. I rarely hear people make this comparison which surprises me with all of the Midwesterns here. I'll sometimes hear comparisons to Madison and it's nothing like that except for the politics.  Anyway, the job didn't work out as planned and a year and a half later I ended up moving back to LA to take another job. Decent paying jobs in the non-profit Arts world are rare so you kind of have to go where they are. \n\nAnyway, ended up taking a job again in the Bay area which was far too expensive to live and in 2018 my wife and I decided we needed to make a choice. We had to move somewhere where the rent wasn't insane, or as insane as the Bay area, and where it checked off the boxes of friends, art, culture, and nature. Portland kept topping that list and here we are. This time for good. \n\nAll of that preamble was just to say that living here in 2012 and 2013 and then moving back in 2018 I saw a big difference just in that 5-year span. It's hard to exactly pinpoint what it was, but the vibe changed a bit. The city felt a bit more... uncertain? It had just experienced this heyday of the early 2010s and you could feel the shift starting to happen to the next phase. And then covid smacked us in the ass and said how you doing. And now here I am. Just a little over 10 years since I moved to Portland the first time and it's the same Portland but it's not. It still feels like the perfect West Coast City for someone that grew up in the midwest that wanted to get out but still feels comfort in some of that Midwest vibe. \n\nI guess all of this is just to say that I love that St. Johns has somehow just stayed St. Johns. We've got the best bridge, a killer jazz festival, easy access to Forest Park, decent restaurants that aren't overpriced, dive bars that have probably existed since Carter was President, and it's got one of the closest knit communities I've felt in this city. Even Kenton got kind of bougie for a bit, then didn't. That's not to say that St. Johns hasn't changed, but it hasn't changed as much as the rest of the city has since 2010. Maybe that's because in Portland math, St. Johns is 5 hours away from everything. And for all the grit and shine and everything in between, I do love this city. I may get pissed off when I'm stuck waiting for a train on Columbia, but at least I get to stare at a snow-capped mountain listening to KMHD while I'm doing it.	1	\N	2025-04-29 16:21:43.500393+00	2025-04-29 16:21:43.500393+00	2025-04-29 15:36:03+00	f	mpobzv1

I \\*love\\* Portland and Vancouver, WA so far, the area is beautiful honestly. \n\nIn Seattle I manage and throw large parties/events and a lot of the folks who come to those are people who play with me in World of WarCraft: Anniversary, we're all Horde, in the same guild, and are very active. We've been meeting a ton of other people in game who are locals to Seattle and Portland and since I just moved down here, I thought I'd see if the locals here would be interested in joining us to play World of WarCraft and come hang out at some meetups and parties that I'm planning to throw in the city soon! \n\nWe have a IG you can check out to see our crowd from Seattle: [https://www.instagram.com/seattlerollingbones](https://www.instagram.com/seattlerollingbones) \n\nRooftop parties are the main thing that we tend to do, but lots of the folks who hang out at them are also fellow guildies, and since we have a lot of members in our guild from around Portland, we wanted to post on here and get you guys to come play with us!\n\nTurns out World of WarCraft is a really great tool to meet folks with, and several of our Seattle area members have been friends with us for years - it's got a real community kind of vibe to it. \n\nNow that I live in Portland, we want to have the same vibes down  here if possible - play WoW with locals - maybe come out to some meetups and parties - get to know your neighbors and fellow gamers a bit more, etc. \n\nI can hook you guys up with a link to our Discord server as well, just drop a comment and lmk! \n\n(Paraphrasing - I had a much better description written before but I can't remember it all now lol please upvote this comment to get it to the top lol)	36	\N	2025-04-29 16:22:10.1334+00	2025-04-29 16:22:10.1334+00	2025-04-28 22:22:47+00	f	mpk6py0

But it makes no sense when it would be ten bucks for my wife and I vs 5-7 for evening street parking. Plus the max would easily add 30+ minutes to the time it takes us to just drive ourselves.

And parking is still comparable in price (if not cheaper) than Tri-Met. \n\nThere won't be improvements unless driving becomes slower or more expensive or unless service can be improved and sped up. \n\nImproving service will take money and political will, neither of which we seem to have in abundance.	32	\N	2025-04-29 16:22:44.405601+00	2025-04-30 00:16:28.826711+00	2025-04-29 16:16:01+00	f	mpok500

My freshman has recently started  taking the bus to school and on the weekends we’ve been tooling around by taking the bus somewhere. Parking sucks everywhere, drivers are insane, the potholes are atrocious. The bus, you get on, sit, look at your phone for a bit, get off, get some steps in, actually pay attention to the neighborhood you just travelled to. I keep telling all my friends just take the damn bus. Depending on where you’re going it only add a bit of time to the trip plus you don’t have to drive.	49	\N	2025-04-29 16:22:44.364766+00	2025-04-30 00:16:28.878409+00	2025-04-29 14:55:57+00	f	mpo3ovt

You could take the same data and say that ridership has increased by over 50% since the pandemic.  \n  \nFor anyone who is using pre-pandemic ridership as a measuring stick-it will keep coming up short. The overwhelming majority of all public transit usage is and always has been commuters. People don't commute to the office as much since the pandemic taught us that letting people work from home instead of commute to an office is a win-win scenario. Trimet is a great system, and ridership is still high enough to justify it.	54	\N	2025-04-29 16:22:44.342549+00	2025-04-30 00:16:29.184117+00	2025-04-29 14:34:04+00	f	mpnz8ml

I wear everyday clothes and am on a commuter bike, and it's ridiculous how frequently a Lycra-wearing cyclist on a more "serious"-looking bike will just put themselves in front of me at a red light only to set off slower than my speed once the light turns green. Don't pass other cyclists until you know that you are actually going faster than them.	10	\N	2025-04-29 23:24:15.688972+00	2025-04-30 00:02:39.583799+00	2025-04-29 20:34:25+00	f	mpq2c8f

Most of the coastal towns are similar versions of each other yet drastically different. Newport, Oregon is vastly different than Lincoln City. Yet the cities are only like 20 miles from each other. \n\nThe whole of the Oregon coast is beautiful and lovely. It does get colder the more north you go but it's the coast. \n\nHope this helps.	5	\N	2025-04-29 23:25:38.17226+00	2025-04-30 00:04:01.190684+00	2025-04-29 16:28:07+00	f	mpomm35

It seems like a real focus on Cascadia issues would probably serve these parties well.	3	\N	2025-04-29 23:33:02.631515+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.565329+00	2025-04-29 19:23:14+00	f	mppne5g

A main idea of Cascadia is to undermine the US as an imperial power over the region. So a new political society needs to be built within our region that supplants the US.\n\nIn Ireland, after centuries of colonization, in 1801 the Act of Union brought it formally into Great Britain, and they had a certain amount of representatives in Parliament at Westminster. For decades these politicians struggled for Repeal of the Union and Home Rule. Then, after not achieving either of these and the 1916 Easter Rising, they moved to just set up an extralegal government of their own. Eventually this set in to motion full independence.\n\nI always mention dual power when I come onto this subreddit. I am really disenchanted by US politics, both in its national and mainstream forms, and I generally take an anarchist/communist approach. Murray Bookchin's municipal libertarianism ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray\\_Bookchin#Municipalism\\_and\\_communalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bookchin#Municipalism_and_communalism) ) is a good source of ideas for me. But I don't really care if people take more electoral paths, all I want is to see the US dismantled and some new confederation of states created to provide a way forward, ideally rooted more in bioregionalism and a respect for the earth and sovereignty.\n\nSo breeding local politicians who might form the nucleus of a Cascadian Party sounds fine. And of course bringing up the idea more in the current political atmosphere which is more suited to rebellion against overbearing political structures. Pressuring current Democratic politicians about, if not Independence, at least devolution of power and regional autonomy.\n\nAnyways I'm just some bum in my room on the internet, but I think creating networks that are based in Cascadia (mutual aid networks, militia associations, union confederations, neighborhood assemblies) and which straight up don't even CONSIDER the rest of the country except in terms of solidarity with Trump's and the US's depredations of other people. DC should just straight up be regarded as obsolete, superfluous, and illegitimate.	2	\N	2025-04-29 23:33:02.64591+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.584355+00	2025-04-29 21:28:03+00	f	mpqddi4

It wasn't that long ago when a 1/4th of my community was in poverty and unemployed. It used to be horrible. The labor and economic reforms that that our statewide democratic administrations and legislatures have put into place in the past decade have significantly improved conditions. Even with the rise in homelessness and crime that's occurred things are still far better, and even those are starting to decline now. And there's been a noticeable shift away from the more moderate/corporate dems to ones that are either social democrats or socialists.	2	\N	2025-04-29 23:33:02.649957+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.590767+00	2025-04-29 21:57:19+00	f	mpqj12d

There's numerous parties. \n\n  \n[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/national-political-parties.aspx](https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/national-political-parties.aspx)  \n\n\nThe problem with suggesting that we should vote for a different party is that you don't hire for an exclusive expert level position that requires decades of experience to someone who has zero practical experience. Get good candidates at a local level, run a good campaign and then run for the state office.

The two party system has taken every state that isn't a "battleground" state for granted.  This part of the continent; so far from the political centers, especially.  We have been used and abused by the Democrats here in Oregon and Washington, and by the Republicans in Idaho.  They have used wedge issues to distract and divide us regionally.  The national parties see states as squares on a chess board, not the living bio-geography that the land truly is.  \n\nPractically though, no-one outside the two-party system has a chance in a winner takes all election.  Bernie Sanders is an exception that proves the rule. Ranked choice voting could work, but it has its own problems. The Working Families Party endorses democrats when it does not stand a chance at their own candidate, the Cascadian party could do something similar until another solution is achieved.	1	\N	2025-04-29 23:33:02.656967+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.600327+00	2025-04-29 19:28:47+00	f	mppojfg

You need to win elections, and you do that by appealing to voters. And the 1/3 won’t vote for candidates who can legislate correctly, if you refuse to accept that reality. \n\nWant to know why Trump won? Because democrats spent the entire time telling the largest voting base that they should fuck off and move aside for the minority, rather than recognize that appealing to the majority can get you to the same destination.

Ride accordingly.\n- Make eye contact with drivers when riding around cars. It helps, in my experience.\n- If you're riding on a multi use path, aim your light at the path, and don't use the literal brightest possible light available. Otherwise you'll blind other path users.\n- Watch out for railroad tracks, they're slippery devils.\n- Sometimes it's safer to take the lane than to hug a shoulder, on narrow roads. Safety comes from visibility and consistency of behavior.\n- If you're wearing a helmet, make sure you're wearing your helmet correctly. I frequently see riders wearing helmets cocked way back on their heads, or in other ways that negate any protection offered by the helmet.\n- I like ringing my bell at other cyclists I pass	15	\N	2025-04-29 23:24:15.67928+00	2025-04-30 00:02:39.57991+00	2025-04-29 19:47:56+00	f	mppsi4i

At township, city, county, state. \n\nIt needs a basic platform that is relatable and not easily colored (stolen) by the major parties.\n\nFor instance:\n\nCascadia First - we prioritize the needs and rights of the people and natural resources of Cascadia before the interests of distant bureaucrats and corporations.\n\nChildren First - we stand for free education for our children, including pre K through trade school or college. We believe all children deserve quality free day care. We believe it is the duty of Cascadia to provide universal free health care to every Cascadian child.\n\nLand, Sky, and Water First - we are the stewards of Cascadia. We will protect and promote the land, sky and water so that our children will have a better, cleaner Cascadia to live in.\n\nLiberty, Life, Personal Autonomy First - we stand for the right of every individual to determine their own fate, control their own body, choose their own religion or creed, and speak their own words and truth. No government local or foreign may take our individual autonomy or right to free expression.\n\n\n\nThis list could be added to. There would need to be commitment to the rights of indigenous peoples, the rights of women. Universal Health care. The idea would be to Frame everything in the context of Cascadia. And make everything flow from a few basic principles that the Democratic party would struggle to copy whole clothes.  These principles need to be practice and applicable LOCALLY. Meaning, we use them to take over school boards, city councils, etc, then move to State level offices.	15	\N	2025-04-29 23:33:02.620193+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.546179+00	2025-04-29 19:00:37+00	f	mppiqac

One of the main reasons for protest is to get people’s attention, including by spreading powerful images. The drone or very large group images are especially powerful in my opinion— the ones where you can’t really make out anyone’s face anyway. The photos are also really motivating and encouraging, and I think they help get more people out there.\n\nI don’t think photos of just a few people are very meaningful in this context, for the most part, so I’d encourage focusing on the large group photos. Or just signs (without faces) if there are specific cool signs to share.\n\nOf course privacy is a concern, and I think people can opt to wear masks, hats, sunglasses if they prefer not to have their face on camera.

It makes too much sense and funds too many pensions for them to be interested in setting up “forced” societal rehabilitation. \n\nI put quotations because it’s not truly forced, just incentivized because the other option is jail and being charged with everything they found in the sweep, drugs, guns, warrants, stolen vehicles, etc. OR, you go to this societal rehabilitation program where you have to stay clean (or go to jail for drugs) and get a job, pay your rent, and then after 2 years or so you “graduate” from the program and if you’re a 2nd time offender you risk going to jail with whatever it is you were doing at the time (illegal camping, dumping, drugs, guns, etc.) \n\nMOST of the time, people who are around others who want to succeed and develop healthy habits are able to pull out of those bad spots for good. There’s been hundreds of studies on habit formation when it comes to lifestyle choices. Take the Vietnam War cocaine addictions as one of the biggest/most popular examples. \n\nThe bleeding hearts here don’t like the idea of jail to treat addiction/chronic homelessness but you ask anyone whose been through the prison system if it helped and they’ll all say YES. Because it forces them into sobriety and gives their brain a chance to mellow out and actually think about their decisions. Instead of being caught in a fiend cycle where they’re not even really making those decisions consciously because the addiction rules. Doesn’t happen in jail. Of course they can still smuggle drugs but again there are major consequences and so most of the time they don’t.	7	\N	2025-04-30 00:13:09.92799+00	2025-04-30 00:13:09.92799+00	2025-04-29 21:51:16+00	f	mpqhvuz

A lot of people here believe that they're anti-racist because they're leftists but will engage in the same micro-agressions and do it in a really patronizing way.\n\n There's also the issue that because Portland is so queer (I believe #2 in the country) real anti-queer oppressesion isn't a major issue, so you get a lot of white queers who think they're deeply oppressed and are completely out of touch with the reality of what queers in the rest country are dealing with. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the PNW is my home, I love it deeply, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.

The best feedback I have gotten from BIPOC customers visiting is that we are a very friendly bunch here in Portland (which makes me happy to hear). That being said, the general vibe I get from my Black friends is that it can be difficult to find community here. As others have said, the PacNW is pretty white comparatively, and Portland (and Oregon in general) has some very racist history that a lot of people don’t know about or like to sweep under the rug. I’ve heard some friends talk about unspoken sundown towns (Oakridge, Lake Oswego, etc). If you stick to the Willamette Valley (basically along the I5 corridor that runs the length of the state) especially in “college towns/cities” (so Eugene, Corvallis, Salem, Portland) you’ll be just peachy. But go too far east (or even west, I grew up on the coast) and it can get pretty conservative.

You will want to get a near infrared light and maybe take a vitamin D supplement. The winters don't get very cold, especially considering the latitude, but the sun is pretty much non-existent for 4-5 months. Oh, and the persistent rain. You will not need an umbrella though, because the majority of the time the rain doesn't wet your person. I miss the South and will move back at some point.

There are a lot of overtly white supremacist and transphobic extremists in Oregon who come into Portland or live in Portland and pick on people, and there are many more extremely racist white people hiding behind liberal ideologies and the fact that they have a rainbow BLM sign in their yard. That said, there are some really cool subcultures in Portland where queer community and/or counter culture is alive and well. But it is not the utopia people are led to believe here in the pnw and as others have said the city is by the vast majority white and has a history of racist exclusionary housing practices, both legally (red lining, oregon's history as a whites only state) and systemically via gentrification and white out-of-staters buying up housing and retail property in historically Black neighborhoods.	1	\N	2025-04-30 00:13:36.894861+00	2025-04-30 00:13:36.894861+00	2025-04-29 18:06:01+00	f	mpp7f5j

Transition Projects Clark Center offers private showers and gives out toiletries like razors and toothpaste. \n\nWhat may be in short supply:\n\n1. Laundry facilities.  Clean O Rama on NW 26th &amp; Thurman is the only coin (or actually they're converting to a phone app from coins) laundry downtown. There are washers and dryers at Clark Commons but those will have limited availability only when Clark Commons is open. \n\n2. Nice clothes to wear to job interviews.\n\n3. A place to store your stuff so you can go to a job interview without looking like a homeless person. I used to carry a small lock with me and use construction site porta potties to store my stuff when construction was inactive. You can lock them from the outside with a small padlock. \n\n4. A place to stay. A person who wants to can convert from homelessness to having a job in 3 to 4 months. I did it twice. You need to be able to keep yourself clean and presentable, not look homeless or you probably won't get a job.\n\n5. Dental services. I've seen a dental office on wheels come through downtown Portland once per year or so, other than that, the homeless are out of luck. The pain of an infected tooth can cause someone to try pulling it out with pliers, which will likely break it rather than remove it. Transition Projects used to give out one voucher per day for tooth extraction, I don't know if they still do.	6	\N	2025-04-30 00:14:25.781665+00	2025-04-30 00:14:25.781665+00	2025-04-29 21:02:37+00	f	mpq8aau

I've had dogs of my own for several years and also worked with local rescues, and I've learned that shopping around a bit makes a huge difference in the cost of care. \n\nI'd consider anything under $500 or so to be very affordable for a spay. Willamette Valley Animal Hospital is one of the lower-cost local options, and they're great. I believe Vista Pet Hospital is also affordable. There are even low-cost options if you're willing to drive a bit (Homeward Bound in McMinnville is one option). Some of the lower-cost clinics do a ton of spays and neuters, so they're experienced and their quality of care is excellent. \n\nAn 'average' vet would probably be $600+ depending on the size of dog and whether or not you do pre-op bloodwork. \n\nAnything over $1,000 seems quite high, unless there's some sort of unusual complication.	1	\N	2025-04-30 00:15:20.477868+00	2025-04-30 00:15:20.477868+00	2025-04-29 17:06:38+00	f	mpounyq

In the latter case, when the driver wants a charge, they deploy the cable from the spool (hidden in the car body) and connect to the outlet. No valuable cable is left hanging to steal and salvage.\n\nFor some completely incomprehensible reason, the gas station hose model was used for 'fueling' EVs, instead of the electrical appliance model, where the device to be charged has the cable. I don't see any charging cables hanging off my walls in my home so I can use electrical appliances, and I don't know why these valuable EV charging cables are left lying out for thieves and vandals to detach and salvage.\n\nI suppose it is far too late to change this, but it should be changed.	1	\N	2025-04-30 00:16:10.206712+00	2025-04-30 00:16:10.206712+00	2025-04-30 00:03:29+00	f	mpr5wxc

I used to occasionally see fare inspectors on the train, but I don't recall ever encountering one on a bus. One of the drivers I know advises me that they receive zero support for fare evaders from management, and considering the mental health and drug abuse issues many of the evaders exhibit, it isn't safe for the drivers / operators to engage these folks on their own, especially late at night.\n\n I'll also chime in and agree with the concerns about the amount of time a trip by TriMet takes and how unreliable the service is. I live in Milwaukie and work downtown. On a bad day it takes me twenty minutes to commute to my office by car, and I have a secure garage to park in that costs me \\~$100 a month pre-tax. Conversely, the trip by TriMet requires a fifteen minute walk to the bus stop, a fifteen to thirty minute wait for a bus, followed by a thirty minute trip to the Hollywood Max station, and then another five minute or so wait for a train, and then a final ten minute ride to the Convention Center - assuming it isn't too hot or too cold for the MAX to run at its normal speed, and also assuming that there isn't some other issue affecting the bus. Further, my employer doesn't underwrite the cost of an annual pass for TriMet, and the last I checked it was well over $100 a month for the pass (I honestly don’t know what the cost is currently). So, even conceding that the costs are generally the same, travel time by TriMet is more than three times as long for each leg of my commute - assuming everything works like it’s supposed to. I’d like to be able to use TriMet, but my time is worth something too, never mind the hassle of having to wait in inclement weather, nor of the ongoing safety issues riders are forced to manage on their own due to a lack of LE.	5	\N	2025-04-30 00:16:29.941458+00	2025-04-30 00:16:29.941458+00	2025-04-29 18:14:32+00	f	mpp96jy

I swear the vast majority of negative comments are coming from people who rode the System 1 time during the pandemic and write it off forever. But the answer to the problems of the system isn't to cut funding and stop building transit, it's to invest more money to improve the system. We need things like the downtown MAX tunnel and we need more funding to increase frequency and expand service not cut it. \n\nThis is a vital system that plenty of people rely on to get around and not just to go to work or to the airport but to get around town. If you like how walkable and pleasant so much of this town is you should support more transit not less. If we never built the max this town would be a car focused hellscape like most of the rest of the country.

I lived in Depoe Bay for 6 years and always went north for razor clams. The northern beaches have a conservation closure every year to allow populations to grow and increase, and you can certainly tell the difference. \n\nFor the past several months razor clamming has been closed south of Cascade Head due to biotoxins.

We see you—those of you in the streets, on the front lines of protest, whispering truth in workplaces, in precincts, in barracks, and in boardrooms. What you are doing is righteous, historic, and necessary.\n\nThe time to protest—persistently, peacefully, and with strategic precision—is not just now, but always. Every opportunity to gather, to speak, to disrupt the machinery of corruption must be taken. Your courage reverberates far beyond your borders. Your resistance, now known around the world as the 50501 Movement, has sparked a planetary awakening against oligarchy and proto-fascism. From Berlin to Buenos Aires, from Toronto to Taipei, inspired communities are rising—not just with you, but because of you.\n\nIn this global struggle, the most effective tool remains peaceful but targeted civil disobedience. We urge you to sharpen your efforts by focusing on the economic arteries that feed the billionaires and their political enablers:\n\n • Boycott and disrupt corporations complicit in lobbying for authoritarian policies or profiting off deregulation, deportation, or disinformation. Amazon, ExxonMobil, BlackRock, and others must be held accountable not through rhetoric, but through relentless economic pressure.\n\n • Flood public spaces with human presence: from financial districts to stock exchanges, to the headquarters of media conglomerates whitewashing tyranny. Disrupt business-as-usual. Make capital feel what democracy demands.\n\n • Support workers and unions—and resist every effort to dismantle them. General strikes, sick-outs, coordinated work slowdowns: these are moral acts of nonviolent warfare against economic feudalism.\n\n • Challenge tech oligarchs like Elon Musk who launder fascist talking points and monopolize platforms while crushing competitors. Demand antitrust enforcement, independent regulation, and mass digital exodus from corporate-controlled platforms.\n \n• Expose and resist Project 2025, which is not merely a policy framework—it is a manifesto for autocracy. Every executive order echoing its language must be met with protest, legal challenge, and direct resistance.\n\nWe know the threats you face. Mass deportations. The invocation of the Insurrection Act. Arresting judges. Defunding truth itself through the Trump administration's targeting of NPR, PBS, and the free press. This is not politics-as-usual. This is structural warfare against democracy. And so, mutual protection is paramount. You must shield each other—physically, legally, emotionally. The most sacred act now is solidarity.\n\nAnd we say this as your neighbours, allies, and siblings in the democratic experiment: \n\nYOU are doing the right thing. You are the moral centre of the 21st century. You are not alone. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you—some literally, in your cities, streets, and movements. We have crossed the border not just in solidarity, but in shared destiny. Our futures are bound together in this fight for our collective freedoms.\n\nSo speak to your friends. Inspire your families. Engage your co-workers. Whisper truth to power within the police, the National Guard, the military—every system must be questioned, and every conscience ignited.\n\nLet your courage be contagious. Let your resistance be refined. And never forget: you are on the side of justice. History bends, yes—but only when millions of hands reach out to pull it.\n\nWith unwavering love and solidarity,\n\nA Canadian Who Believes in You!\n\nTogether We Will Win!\n\nGC	5	\N	2025-05-03 23:50:52.555759+00	2025-05-03 23:50:52.555759+00	2025-05-03 03:55:23+00	f	mqbghmu

I moved on to drums since I wanted to improve my rhythm. And then eventually started leaning toward guitars to help with melody and voicing. I'm no spectacular drummer or guitarist but I can hold a beat, play to a click, break out a good lick. I regard bass as my primary instrument. I've done open mics out here just singing and playing bass which I have not seen anyone else do. I own a 4 string elec. A 4 string acoustic.

Face / body coverings, non-identifiable clothing / accessories, not bringing your phone, etc... Hiding your identity even if you don't care about your identity being known also helps those who wish to hide their identity. You wearing face coverings and non-identifiable clothing helps the other person wearing the same blend in. \n\nContext is also hugely important. If things get dicey and/or police declare the protest a riot or similar, do not post any photos of attendees. Don't post anyone who may be perceived as breaking the law. If you have to ask yourself, "should I be posting this?". Don't post it. If someone clearly doesn't want to be filmed or has taken steps to conceal their identity, don't post photos of 'em. \n\nUltimately, remember why you are there and who you are there for. If an attendee asks you to stop filming / taking photos of them don't do some sovereign citizen shit and talk about your right to take photos. I understand its tempting and may feel righteous, but don't. Just stop taking photos. Respect the wishes of fellow attendees.	7	\N	2025-05-03 23:50:52.563271+00	2025-05-03 23:50:52.563271+00	2025-05-03 01:30:54+00	f	mqauxy0

Keeping habitat in the checkerboard land west of Eugne is a win for wildlife, hunters, and outdoors enthusiasts alike.\n\nEdit: and if you support these wins, get involved. Currently the Blue &amp; Gold logging project out of Roseburg BLM is getting auctioned off. Old growth trees and marbled marlettes are at risk because the BLM wants to log critical habitat.

Well, I guess I’m thankful that god picked two Christian, conservative, and republican—can you really be one without the other these days?!—individuals who coincidentally happened to be white Oregonians as my parents, and not say….a couple born in the Gaza refugee camps. Clearly those Gazan children picked the wrong parents and culture and language, and clearly it’s ok that our tax dollars are supporting the ongoing Israeli genocide of those children, who, naturally, are born terrorists by definition. \n\nFortunately, as a good US Christian, the blessed kind!, all I need to do to feel better about my above narrative digression is meditate upon a couple of Christian prayers. They’ll clear my conscious right up and remind me that it’s ok to be blessed by god while other humans are cursed for their lifestyle choices. \n\nLet’s see, there’s “the lord helps those who help themselves”, and “the Lord works in mysterious ways.” And for an even more guilt free glee with a hearty dollop of self-righteousness, I recommend adding, “as a Christian, it’s not my job to judge.” \n\nAhhhh such relief from having to think critically about complex issues!\n\n/end of snarky rant about Christian, conservative, and republican hypocrisy.  \n\nLET THE CHRISTIAN WHO IS WITHOUT SIN cast the first downward vote!	3	\N	2025-05-01 05:32:01.960179+00	2025-05-01 05:32:01.960179+00	2025-04-30 17:39:38+00	f	mpvjtb2

For me, a high school math teacher in a suburban district that mandates this, it is worse.  So much worse. \n\nIn theory, the idea is to communicate about learning targets (areas of strength and need for growth, both) instead of evaluating.  Part of the idea may be not hurting kids’ feelings. But part of the idea is definitely helping pinpoint academic needs. \n\nBut it doesn’t work that way. \n\nThe most assertive kids focus on their goals (grades).   This isn’t the “learning for learning” sake that we all pine for, but it is sufficient to help pressure kids to behave (academically) toward their goals.  But the vast majority of kids just kinda want to…get along?  They don’t care about specific learning targets, and their parents would need to become curriculum masters in multiple subjects to help them.  It doesn’t work. \n\nAll grading is done via rubric.  But rubrics are fundamentally just as arbitrary as a percent-based system.  I have never seen a rubric, in any subject, that didn’t rely on weasel-words “consistently”, “occasionally”, etc. I am required to use rubrics, and I do my best to make them sensical….but no.  They never make sense. And the kids don’t know how to read them well, despite hours upon hours of class time spent going over them. (And, to be frank, we don’t have those hours to spend.)\n\nMy (teaching) district has a conversion from standards to letter grades that is extremely generous.  It is nowhere near the first drafts of the system. This is likely because students were unable to meet the actual standards with any level of consistency. \n\nNot having a standards based edict is one reason I have been so grateful my own children attend PPS. My older child graduated a PPS high school with a consistently engaging course of study, and she left prepared for her liberal arts dream school on the east coast. (Not every class. Not every teacher.  Goodness no. But overall yes.)\n\nMy 7th grader, I hope, will have a similar opportunity at her high school in a couple of years.  Her PPS middle school already reports only based on standards, and viewing her progress is a hot mess.  I understand how to read the ParentVue information, but it takes a lot of pausing and reading between the lines. \n\nSome teachers will disagree with me. I defer to their preference for their practice. But I have tried, for oh so long, to figure out how to make my work school make sense to my students and families. And I find they are just often intimidated into silence by the system. \n\nThe horrible irony is that this is often introduced in the spirit of “equity”.  I’m a huge believer in some difficult decisions in favor of equity. But I have now worked at a richer and a poorer high school in my district, and the grading system ruins learning so much more at the poorer school.  It’s a tragedy, really.	33	\N	2025-05-01 05:33:50.919851+00	2025-05-02 01:40:09.758882+00	2025-05-01 02:19:01+00	f	mpyacy5

It's owned/operated by a married couple, and has been around for like 20-ish years. It's a small, chill family friendly (family style) spot, with a couple of outside tables, and in the summer the front window at the counter is a roll up. So it's just a really cool neighborhood cafe type of atmosphere. :)\n\nAside from the awesome handmade (by her parents, IIRC) dumplings, the menu has dishes from/representing Asian nations from India to China. But, it's a limited menu, so you know what you are getting is going to be done to perfection. So as a family / date spot, if one of you wants pad thai, one wants kung pao, rice and peanut sauce for the kids, etc., everyone/anyone can find something they like, and share it. :)	1	\N	2025-05-01 05:34:08.164753+00	2025-05-01 05:34:08.164753+00	2025-05-01 04:07:53+00	f	mpyqwvd

Some years are really wet and cold until after the Fourth of July. Others warm up and are dry until October.   One thing for sure it never used to get so hot in the summer.  The reason so few older homes have air conditioning is it wasn’t necessary.  The past 10 years or so we’ve been getting 100degree weather which was unheard of when I grew up in the 60’s.	29	\N	2025-05-01 05:34:47.673516+00	2025-05-01 05:34:47.673516+00	2025-04-30 16:07:51+00	f	mpv0ubt

What that actually means is if you're planning an outdoor wedding or something, and *absolutely need* for it to not be raining, wait until mid-late summer. It's definitely not the constant drizzle of winter.\n\nSpring is typically all over the place; plenty of warm sunny days, plenty of sporadic rainstorms, some cool days, lots of "all 4 seasons in one day." A couple years ago it snowed in April. This spring has definitely been warmer and sunnier than average, but not *wildly* so.	1	\N	2025-05-01 05:34:47.821045+00	2025-05-01 05:34:47.821045+00	2025-04-30 21:13:35+00	f	mpwrx0z

Speaking very generally November - February is mostly rain. July - August is almost entirely sun.

As to what is normal, it all depends on how long you have lived in the PNW. Living in the PNW for 40+ years, yea, it is normal. Always carry something for rain, sweatshirt jacket etc. Always have a blanket for the early evening park hangouts, never rely on the coast being shorts weather.

I've been here since last June. That didn't happen at all.

I love a lot of things, and feel like it’s all important, including culture AND the trees. I need someone who wants to protect and be in nature.. but I’m also sometimes tired of every man here being like “I need someone super active.” I want someone to see spirituality in the trees, but someone who does not use nature and hiking and exercise as almost a distraction from themselves.

An animal org is not going to want to spend their very limited time and resources to accommodate your daughter’s credit needs. That’s not what they’re here for. They need long term volunteers, not someone who will only be there for a few weeks. Funding for nonprofit organizations is not only very low, it’s actively dropping in this economic and political climate. They don’t have time to do anything that doesn’t serve the mission (like training students who will quit when they get their credit requirements). \n\nI recommend a cleanup with SOLVE, they are doing them all the time and it’s a fun way to spend time outdoors, especially if you’re doing it with family or friends.	86	\N	2025-05-01 05:35:56.072783+00	2025-05-01 05:35:56.072783+00	2025-04-30 17:48:35+00	f	mpvlps4

It would make more sense to look for a volunteer event that does not require training - trash pickup, for example.

There is no hope for the future if no one has the political will to act.	6	\N	2025-05-01 05:36:44.93197+00	2025-05-01 05:36:44.93197+00	2025-04-30 22:15:47+00	f	mpx3sy3

If I have my way and funds allow, I'd like to build it using ICF or AAC and make it as fireproof as reasonable practical.  Metal or green roof.  Metal siding or stucco or something.  (Due to the not-great fire truck access and not-quite-good-enough water flow rate at the hydrant, I'll be required to have non flammable siding and an inside sprinkler system anyways.)\n\nI'm not sure what's possible in terms of making a building that can withstand a major fire for hours/days though.  That's a lot of heat.  Even if it doesn't catch fire, I can't imagine it would do the cement and rebar any good, what with thermal expansion and all.\n\nI had wondered about whether removing ivy actually makes any difference in terms of fire risk.  The article mentions that invasive species help the fire to get up into the tops of the trees, which makes sense given ivy's tendency to grow up the sides of tree trunks.\n\nI've also wondered if there are certain native plants that are substantially more flammable than others.  The property is in a conservation zone, so I basically have to have native plants, but if I have my choice what new native plants to add, are there some in particular I should avoid?	1	\N	2025-05-01 05:36:44.940737+00	2025-05-01 05:36:44.940737+00	2025-04-30 21:21:51+00	f	mpwtjoe

Instead, the district will no doubt continue to double down on policies that have driven enrollment declines far worse than national or state enrollment declines.  \n\nFor example, my child’s school had a small but helpful reading program. The district just took the program away from our school. They decided to centralize the contract and give the program only to schools with a certain proportion of “historically underserved” students. Infuriatingly, the district specifically mentioned “foundation funding” in their communications about this even though they purposefully eliminated the foundations last year. It drives me bonkers how *lazy* it is to assume that every child attending a school in a well-off, white neighborhood by definition needs nothing and should expect nothing from this district.

So, while admin is bloated, that isn't anywhere near to the driver of the budget issues. Rather, the fact that PPS has refused to close schools, sell land/buildings, and thus be able to pass more levies than just construction bonds has proven to be a fatal flaw in their math. \n\nPerhaps it is time for PPS to be less concerned about equity for the few (looking at you $450m remodel for the 465 Jefferson students), and be more concerned about the improving the horrific outcomes for everybody.\n\nEdit: Not advocating for PPS admin to be harmed.

It also only aids this current federal administration agenda.\n\n Ultimately the people with the most wealth want you to be mad at unions because it allows them to retain that wealth. \n\n"Angela said there was this much money and then there wasn't" Pitchforks for Angela, that's someone we can attack." \n\nMeanwhile the ununionzied places like Nike who fund the candidates that are going to tax them the least are never out here on the WW or Oregonian headlines. \n\n \nGuadalupe is one of many district leadership people that ran this district into the ground. While I despise Guadalupe he's one person, and we're not talking about him anymore cause he's not here.\n\nShifting all the responsibilities of aging public buildings and decades of mismanagement of funds like were going to change things right away isn't mathing. \n\nWe have historically underfunded our schools. \n\nThe whole concept of don't support this bond because the money will continue to be mismanaged is frustrating because ultimately, the humans that pay the price are our students. Some people have the privilege of unenrolling their kids in public schools, much of our immigrant community does not.\n\n\nWed still have a ton of issues to be navigating in Portland schools even if we would of had a great prior superintendent. \n\nOur public schools need a lot! \n\nWhat are solutions to fund a better system?\n\nAs an educator and PPS parent who works a full work week, volunteers most of my evenings to the union, and misses out on a lot of stuff with my kids. The union has been one of the few things that helps me stay in the classroom serving our students. \n\nWhile no system or organization is perfect, Im giving it a shout out for the hope it provides to fight this privatization that my immigrant students are also impacted by.	-5	\N	2025-05-01 05:37:29.628408+00	2025-05-01 05:37:29.628408+00	2025-04-30 22:35:19+00	f	mpx7aln

Then you need to go for something professional-grade like MaxForce or OptiGuard ant gel, such as: https://www.pestcontrolproductsdepot.com/products/optigard-ant-bait-gel?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&amp;pr_rec_id=0c25448c1&amp;pr_rec_pid=6746887422158&amp;pr_ref_pid=6746876444878&amp;pr_seq=uniform\n\nWe've found these products to be highly effective. They don't kill ants immediately, they're designed to be carried back to the nest where it gets fed to the queen and accumulates to the point where she's killed and soon after the nest dies (because when the queen stops pumping out ant-babies, the nest dies). Takes  2 or 3 days, but it's highly effective in our experience for all kinds of ants including carpenter ants. This is easy to DIY if you choose the right weapon.

We originally were using their services for rats, but eventually started getting an ant problem that we couldn't control with Terro traps. \n\nThey came and sprayed areas in our home where we were seeing the ants come in and then sprayed around the perimeter of our house. They said that if we continue to see them after two weeks, then to call them and they'll come back and spray again. They also said that their sprays are pet friendly, but to keep pets away from the solution for at least an hour while it dries. \n\nNow they come quarterly and spray around the perimeter for ants and replace the bate in our rat traps! \n\n(They are also really kind people from my experience!)	1	\N	2025-05-01 05:38:39.160095+00	2025-05-01 05:38:39.160095+00	2025-04-30 16:23:45+00	f	mpv434u

The whole point of bait is that they track in back to the nest and feed their family with it, so if they're piling up in the goop the bait isn't making it back home.  \nIf the home defense spray mentions "repelling" or "making a barrier", wait until you've got the situation under control before you use it, otherwise you run the risk of just trapping them inside with you.  \nA little bit of DE goes a long way, if you go overboard with it it will get everywhere and stay everywhere.  \n  \nIf you don't get a handle on things on your own, message me.

My experiences with them (traffic tickets and calling the nonemergency line out of concern for a neighbor's wellbeing) have all been polite, professional, and nonthreatening. Are some cops assholes? Yes, definitely. Do I think that BPD is one of the few departments that really, truly wants what's best for the community and is willing to listen and take feedback from that same community? Yes, I do. If I recall correctly, BPD refused to send any officers downtown during the 2020 protests; they did not want to be involved in that brutal shit-fest.\n\nLike it or not - and you are absolutely entitled not to  - these are the people that will show up when you or someone else calls 911. What harm can come from sitting down and having a conversation with them? At least then, if/when shit hits the fan, you can say that you did everything possible to prevent it. We don't have to go from zero to Stonewall. The cops aren't coming at us with batons and guns drawn.\n\nI'm not an optimistic person. I don't believe the best of everyone I meet.

While, I don’t think this show was the sole reason (all the tech Bros moving here and pushing out the artists, galleries, late night music venues and musicians who could no longer afford to live here), the popularity of Portland and the overall vibe of Portland began to change into a more mainstream city. Great show, though, most Portlanders I know reference it at some point as a joke. I still live here and enjoy it.	2	\N	2025-05-02 01:29:45.460011+00	2025-05-02 01:29:45.460011+00	2025-05-02 01:08:20+00	f	mq4cck2

It’s pretty but, depending on how long your trip is, it may be smarter to focus your time elsewhere. Depoe Bay is a must stop on your coast trip! Check out the whale watching museum overlooking the water. Last week it was packed with whales and some lucky folks spotted orcas!\nETA: the CA drop is only from I-5- my bad! I will say that Depoe Bay should 💯 be on your must see list, though.	1	\N	2025-05-02 01:30:05.564609+00	2025-05-02 01:30:05.564609+00	2025-05-01 15:26:56+00	f	mq17g11

It really was my home away from home. This was back when the only location was in South Town, and it was still tiny and pretty funky. I wish we were still in touch with a couple of the 90s era staff and volunteers there. One Christmas my mom made my sister (clarinet) and I (tuba) play Christmas music in the entry way. It was hilarious, and we made tons of tips even though we sucked. We’d bike down from our house just to hang out, then bike home with mom. When our friends were over, we’d call mom and ask her to bring home various things from the store then we’d all make a huge veggie dinner together. One year we invited a ton of people over for Thanksgiving. I think we had 17 people in our little house, and most were staff and their partners. I think two single people met and started dating after our Thanksgiving. I know they got married, I hope they’re still together.

Dense trees also lead to incredibly hot and out of control fires. So while it may not be what you are used to looking at, the 2020 Labor Day fires were the first step of nature self-correcting very poor management of our PNW forests.	249	\N	2025-05-02 01:38:19.793871+00	2025-05-02 01:38:19.793871+00	2025-05-01 20:07:16+00	f	mq2t3nw

We have a resident beaver who manages the entire area - it created a pond and then re-channeled part of the creek. It has had the effect of flood control in super heavy rains. Previously, the flat portions of the green space up to mine and my neighbor’s property would get inundated with water during storms or heavy rains, but that no longer happens because of where the beaver has moved the water to go. It is always interesting when we notice a sapling suddenly missing or bark pulled off a tree. They have currently chewed halfway through a 15 foot tall ash tree that I keep checking each morning to see if the beaver finally took the rest of it in the night.	11	\N	2025-05-02 01:38:37.33158+00	2025-05-02 01:38:37.33158+00	2025-05-01 14:09:26+00	f	mq0rtut

A guy brought his dog in and proceeded to let it piss all over the gift shop. I had to kick people and their dogs out _constantly_ but if they said it was a service dog I was advised to not say anything else. 9/10 times it was not a service dog. I always assumed this was a west coast thing. In Portland, I have seen dog fights in the middle of Target. I saw unleashed dogs walking around the grocery stores. I walked dogs in college and the amount of people that don’t leash their dogs in public areas here is bonkers to me. One dude I know had a frenchie he never leashed. It ran into the road right under a car one day and did not survive. \n\nLeash laws exist for a reason and dogs don’t belong everywhere. I actually decided against pursuing dog training because the people I was helping train their dogs didn’t care what I had to say, they wanted to continue living their lives and not do the work. No such thing as a perfect dog or a magic switch. They’re dogs. They’re gonna act like dogs unless we teach them otherwise.	12	\N	2025-05-02 01:39:24.343195+00	2025-05-02 01:39:24.343195+00	2025-05-01 19:48:34+00	f	mq2p7hy

The store owner can be fined up to $10,000 for a health code violation. I see dogs with fake "service animal" vests on in coffee shops and grocery stores anyway. A service animal performs a specific task for a handicapped person.  Real service animals are well  behaved and are the only exception to the health code law.  "Emotional support animals" aren't included in the service animal group.

If your dog isn’t trained to stick by you and recalled easily, it should be on a leash when it is outside your fenced property. Some dogs may not be able to be trained in that way and I get that, but that means you need to keep it on a leash.

There’s just too much unpredictably involved and I don’t think that’s necessarily a good thing when it comes to pets (especially dogs who can bite).

There has not been a single walk we have done in the nearly 3 years we've lived here where there has not been a dog off leash (with the exception of maybe Tyron Creek and Reed College for the handful of times we could make it to those places). I'm talking about places that require dogs to be leashed.\n\nIn fact, my smaller dog got bit about a year ago requiring a $2k vet bill. Did I call police? Absolutely. Did they should up? Nope. Did the person with the dog stick around? Nope. I took my dog to the vet as I should have to get medical attention for them.\n\nThan, on top of that, I am a healthcare provider in emergency and urgent settings. We have seen people bring in wildlife (from squirrels to skunks) claiming ADA.\n\nLiving most of my adult life in Chicago and NYC -- I have never experienced the off leash culture like I have out here. It's absolutely wild.\n\nWith that said, I'm grateful to have the self-awareness to choose a breed that fits my lifestyle. Prior to being in healthcare, my spouse and I owned a pet care business and most people do not have that self-awareness.	1	\N	2025-05-02 01:39:24.511488+00	2025-05-02 01:39:24.511488+00	2025-05-01 21:17:10+00	f	mq37h9o

I get very frustrated when I see dogs in stores.  I only go to outdoor spaces, and he stays on a very short leash in those situations. I do try to make sure when walking that people are aware that he is on a short leash and not allowed to say hi unless someone says hi to him.\n\nI will always take a spot at a cafe or outdoor seating with some distance from people. I have on occasions, ridden him back home when going to happy hour with friends because of the number of people in an outdoor space. It drives me a bit nutty when people who have dogs don't respect that:\n\n1. Not everyone has a good relationship with dogs.\n\n2. Some people have allergies.\n\n3. Some people just don't want to go home and deshed their clothes. \n\n4. These are open shared spaces and everyone should feel comfortable,and it isn't about you and you're dog being the main character.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who bought a cargo bike for his dog and brings his dog to the office almost everytime I go into the office.	1	\N	2025-05-02 01:39:24.543426+00	2025-05-02 01:39:24.543426+00	2025-05-01 23:10:10+00	f	mq3s340

In the early 2010s, I raised my daughter right on Burnside, between Providence Park and the Stadium Fred Meyer. It was a wonderful neighborhood.\n\nWe had a top floor unit so we never had to go to a Timbers game. We could tell who was winning.\n\nWe were friends with the chef at Oscar Drakes, and he'd give us free or discount gourmet food sometimes after my daughter got off the school bus.\n\nShe learned to ride her bike right there at the stadium, on days where there were no games. It was grand. How many kids get that kind of cool memory?\n\nShe would walk down to the Dollar Tree that's now The Mox to get snacks or toys.\n\nSleepovers were fun, because it was such a swanky neighborhood and her friends always felt safe and pampered.\n\nIt was so amazingly safe. And full of great memories. We could walk to and from the Rose Test Garden, easily. My daughter used to fall asleep with the big neon Volvo sign up the street as her night light.\n\nAnd cheap too! All this in a deluxe 2 bedroom penthouse for like $600 per month!! We had floor to ceiling windows overlooking Snob Hill. We could see Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Ranier all out the same windows on a sunny day.\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but it seems we moved away right before it started getting bad. And I'm so thankful for it too!\n\nI go through there now and it absolutely breaks my heart. The max stops used to be safe enough that my daughter could catch a ride straight to grandma's house. Now I don't even feel safe going through there, in broad daylight, with a knife on me.\n\nThere's poop, and needles, and drug dealers and fights. More than once I've had to call 911 because someone was passed out in the street. It's horrible. What happened? Who dropped the ball?	4	\N	2025-05-02 01:39:33.461829+00	2025-05-02 01:39:33.461829+00	2025-05-01 22:10:00+00	f	mq3hg8h

It's kind of funny how Republicans Heros are the ones who make society worse for everyone who is not in a gated community.\n\nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, passed by a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and a Republican-controlled Senate, and signed by President Ronald Reagan on August 13, 1981, combined funding for social service programs, including mental health services, into a single grant given to states. Supporters believed this approach gave states flexibility and independence. Critics feared it would result in reduced funding for mental health services and go against the community mental health movements objectives\n\nClose the institutions and flood the streets with crack.

People want to make themselves appear "active and healthy and energetic". \n\nDating profiles also cannot really accurately convey how an individual juggles priorities. For example you may "love the outdoors",. but on a particular night or weekend you may have some other priority (or family is in town or you're sick or whatever). \n\nA dating-profile is more of a temporary "do you want to take this car for a test-drive" ,. .it's not a huge commitment,.. but the window-flyer is still going to typically only have "only positive attributes" ,. but that doesnt' tell you everything about the car.	2	\N	2025-05-02 01:40:56.594847+00	2025-05-02 01:40:56.594847+00	2025-05-01 12:39:26+00	f	mq0c0rs

If you want to succeed at online dating:\n\nStep 1:  Be really attractive.\n\nStep 2:  Visibly have money.  Not like flaunt a nice car or fancy clothes, really master that generational wealth facial expression and posture that only comes from never having stressed about money or housing stability at all and being able to pick jobs that offer competitive time off and actually take fun vacations on a regular basis and use all your vacation every year with the knowledge that you will be able to own a home before 40 and retire by 62.\n\nStep 3:   No seriously, just be conventionally attractive, outdoorsy or not. Men better be 6'+, women better have a BMI between 18 and 24, and you have to have perfect teeth regardless of gender.\n\nStep 4:  Lie, and justify it by telling yourself that everyone else is probably lying too, and assume anyone admitting a flaw is hiding something worse.\n\nStep 5:  if anything isn't literally too good to be true perfect, ghost them, online dating is a game anyways, never stop playing the field.\n\n  \nIf you want to succeed at dating in Portland?  Non-sarcastic answer?  I dunno, just get lucky, and hope that you find someone who has the patience and desire to learn to get to know you and commit.  I met 3 amazing people in 2024, 2 of them online, only 1 of them was outdoorsy.  Did any of them work out?  No.  Have I since learned that their relationships after we broke up also failed?  Also yes.  I think it's just a disaster for everyone at this point, I see a very tiny percentage of people I know entering into and having successful relationships, I'm thinking maybe 3 people I know since covid who started dating someone are now actually in a committed relationship with that person?  I know WAYYYY more people in my social circle who just started buying cats and stopped dating and they at least outwardly \\*act\\* happier than those of us who are still trying to date.	4	\N	2025-05-02 01:40:56.610611+00	2025-05-02 01:40:56.610611+00	2025-05-01 09:18:35+00	f	mpznlk1

No religion or politics. \n\nPlace it at eye level either on your door or near your doorbell. Place it so that there’s no way in hell someone could claim they couldn’t see it unless they’re visually impaired. \n\nIf a solicitor ignores the sign, answer the door and let them talk for a few seconds. Then calmly and politely (at your discretion) let them know that you have a “no soliciting” sign that they chose to ignore and therefore they’re trespassing. Ask them to leave and ask them to permanently remove your address from their route. \n\nIf a solicitor ignores a very clearly worded sign — a sign that’s impossible to miss and doesn’t allow for ANY ambiguity — they are trespassing. \n\nI haven’t had a solicitor knock or ring my doorbell in about eight years. I also don’t receive random flyers for gutter cleaning, house painting, etc.	1	\N	2025-05-02 01:41:14.514014+00	2025-05-02 01:41:14.514014+00	2025-05-02 01:12:46+00	f	mq4d2x0

You will be the annoying person who gaulks anytime someone says a storm is coming and is actually freaked out. People at work were saying there'd be a tornado heading this way and I scoffed and said "back where I am from you'd still be sitting on the porch until the twister made it to your street." I mostly do it as a bit but there is an element of truth. \n\n2. Rain doesn't stop people here. Rain is a constant here so no one stops what they're doing when it rains. Back home if it was raining it was a storm and you were possibly in danger. Here I don't worry about making it to work or my car getting beaten up with hail. \n\n3. The mild temperatures are amazing! I have spent so much more time outdoors here. I can't stand Oklahoma heat so this is amazing for me. Plus the flowers that bloom are incredible. \n\n4. You will need to find solutions for the winter blues. I have always been affected by seasonal affective disorder and it got way worse for me this year than anytime in Oklahoma. The sun doesn't shine as much so even though I'm going outside more I still don't get enough. Vitamins and light therapy have helped a lot though. Just have to figure out what works for you. \n\n5. The trees are so damn tall. They low-key freak me out how tall they can get. In the part of Oklahoma I am from there aren't any trees this tall and they certainly don't stay green all year. \n\n\nLastly, this is unrelated to the weather but there aren't churches on every corner. Like legitimately in my home town there was a church on basically every street. It was ridiculous.	4	\N	2025-05-02 01:41:30.843126+00	2025-05-02 01:41:30.843126+00	2025-05-02 00:01:11+00	f	mq412mq

Getting in with a PCP is going to be rough so hope you're healthy, the wait is long, mental health care --- LOL --- but hey almost everyone here is "working on their mental health" so take that however you wanna.\n\nMaking new friends is either super easy breezy or impossible. There seems to be no like middling area, everyone is awesome and down to hang or you're isolated and weird.\n\nWhile certain areas in Portland are rich and vibrant the predominant culture experience in a lot of hip neighborhoods in Portland is going to be really white. It's something you stop noticing after a while until you go to a city that is more culturally integrated and come back. Also Portland is SUPER small and you notice how small it is only when you leave and come back. This is both bad and good, I suppose, depending on your point of reference. \n\nPassive aggressive bullshit. If you're from the East Coast you'll get slapped with "wow you aggro" when you're basically being a normal East Coaster. You either adapt to the bullshit or get told you're so aggro a lot. Also see: you're walking so fast, why? Can't we enjoy a leisurely stroll???

I identify as a kinkster, not interested in swinging or public sex (NO SHAME!). Each club has its own set of rules, whichever you go to you should let the door person know it's your first time and they will give you the rules.\n\nSanctuary: more of a smaller sex positive kink club. Non gendered pricing that's more accessible for everyone. Very queer friendly, typically a younger crowd. You will probably see more kink here than any of the other clubs, unless you go to the other clubs on kink nights. You are responsible for resetting beds after use (supplied sheets, towels, condoms, and a laundry basket). No showers, food is limited If served at all. I've heard people complain about the alcoholic drinks but I'm sober so I can't vouch. If you go on a slow night, or a little after the event opens, you can ask for a tour and they might give it to you.\n\nVelvet Rope (TVR): expansive sex club. There are many rooms, both public and private. A hot tub, smoking porch, lockers, shower, and food/bar. There can be some kink furniture but mostly it's beds and couches. You will see sex here. I found it's a more "casual" vibe than Privata. There are rooms for couples or females only. There is gendered pricing. Security is VERY serious, they will search your bags. Beds are cleaned by staff between use. All new people get a tour, which is helpful.\n\nPrivata: Smaller sex club downtown. They have 3 levels, with an array of small rooms for private or semi private fun. You will see sex here but maybe not as much as TVR. They also have couples only areas. Typically it feels more fancy than TVR. Food, bar, shower, lockers all available. Also gendered pricing. Beds are cleaned between use by staff. I wasn't offered a tour the first time I went, so I'm not sure if they do that here. \n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to DM. I hope this helps, and I hope you and your partner have a fun time!	4	\N	2025-05-02 01:42:11.836554+00	2025-05-02 01:42:11.836554+00	2025-05-01 15:39:09+00	f	mq19xyc

New homes that are built have their assessed values decreased to what they would be valued at in the 90’s so taxes are fair between new and old homes. This is done by multiplying the RMV by the average difference between RMV and tax assessed value of all homes in Portland.

Toward the end of the year I was really struggling and working full time in an electronics repair shop as a contractor and did not make enough to pay rent and eat. We had an honor system snack box in the break room and I'm ashamed to admit I stole top ramen a couple of times when I was really desperate....I remember getting home from work one day and remembering I had a pack of ramen in my car and was more excited than I'd been in a while knowing I was able to actually eat something that day. I once went 7 days in a row without eating and by day three you start going nuts. The line about the @$$ falling off...yeah that's no joke. I was literally cutting new holes in my belt just to keep my pants up.	8	\N	2025-05-02 01:43:10.126209+00	2025-05-02 01:43:10.126209+00	2025-05-01 23:00:10+00	f	mq3qbt3

All of the food court stalls could be like stationary locations for food carts.

However, managers and supervisors are strictly prohibited from sharing in tip pools. \n\nUnder the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), a manager or supervisor is defined as someone whose primary duty is management, who regularly directs the work of at least two employees, and who has significant input on hiring or firing decisions.  Even if they occasionally perform non-managerial tasks, they still can't receive tips from a pool. \n\nThey can only keep tips that customers give them directly for services they personally and solely provide. \n\nSo, while it's legal to include kitchen staff in tip pools, management must stay out.	61	\N	2025-05-03 23:54:59.02966+00	2025-05-03 23:54:59.02966+00	2025-05-03 01:22:46+00	f	mqatn2k

No way I’m double-frying wings, even for that perfect Korean wingaling.\n\nKigaru Izakaya on Hall is baffling. I *know* you shouldn’t trust a restaurant that tries to do it all. Yet here they are, a tiny hole in the wall with better ramen than Ryoma, better sushi than the high end spots across the way in Cedar Hills Crossing, low-key excellent okonomiyaki and skewers (they serve the scallops with the frills all oldschool), and some of the best tempura I’ve had.\n\nNot as casual, but Din Tai Fung. Sometimes you need soup dumplings.\n\nI spent forever trying to find a good banh mi. Best Baguette guarantees their bread is fresh-baked every hour. The pork pate is legit, and I’m not making pork pate. And their prices are awesome.\n\nDave’s Hot Chicken. This fits the genre you’re craving perfectly. Do not try the “hot chicken” sandwich from New Seasons. It is sadness in a whole wheat bun.\n\nOasis Lebanese is so good, I just got a catered party’s worth of food from them on short notice and really reasonably for the quality. The meat mezze platter claims to be an appetizer but is plenty of food and variety for two for dinner.\n\nSomeone on here was asking about croissants recently, and I realized how lucky I am to have Seasame Donuts and their perfect croissants so near at hand. I need to stop taking them for granted, they’re little labor-intensive miracles.\n\nI can’t be bothered to bake elaborate cakes that are gorgeous but not sickly sweet. With a subsidy off the hot bar/bakery bucks, I’ve got a tira misu or mango cream from 99 Ranch to bring to a party. H-Mart’s bakery isn’t too shabby either.\n\nGive Ate Oh Ate a try (different than 808 Grinds). People are grumpy that Bigs Chicken changed the concept on the space, but it’s honestly delicious.\n\nI used to work by the mini Elephants Deli downtown, and sometimes you need Mama Leones soup for breakfast.

For the noise, invest in some nice headphones.	116	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:20.955538+00	2025-05-03 23:56:20.955538+00	2025-05-03 01:04:29+00	f	mqaqokt

Honestly downtown + first floor (do you mean at street-level or one up?) is a tough combo for your first time in a city. However some pointers as a smaller woman in my 20's:\n\n\\- Pepper gel, not spray; heavy water bottle is also useful \n\n\\- Self-defense class\n\n\\- One headphone in\n\n\\- Don't have a set schedule for turning on/off your lights, you never know who might be getting an idea of when you're home (or not)\n\n\\- Can carry &amp; learn to administer narcan\n\n\\- Look like you know where you're going. On days where it fits, sunglasses help so people can't see if you're lost/confused\n\n\\- Be mindful of how your window opens and how to keep it locked\n\n\\- Don't answer doorbell/buzzer if you're not expecting anyone (might seem like common sense but have heard about people using this method to break in)	57	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:20.980217+00	2025-05-03 23:56:20.980217+00	2025-05-03 01:25:25+00	f	mqau2kd

Made sure the security system stickers were in the windows. \n- Smart outlets with the ability to schedule lights to turn on and off at various times that I would mix up so they weren't always the same, even if I wasn't home. I even had my tv on one. \n- Wedges in the windows to keep them from sliding open. I got the Velcro kind that can be repositioned at different heights\n- I made sure every window had a functioning lock. My landlord wouldn't replace them so I did. It was easy work with a screwdriver\n- I was in a house, so this may not be applicable to your situation, but I attached solar powered motion sensor lights outside near my doors and windows\n\n\nWhen it comes to home break-ins (which I think are rare here, but general fyi) it's about making your home look like it won't be an easy job. Burglars don't want to call attention to themselves. They're opportunistic and want easy burglary jobs. This is where something as simple as the security system sticker on the window acts as a first line deterrent. The window locks are the second line. If they're gonna have to spend time and energy breaking or jimmying a window, they're more likely to move on to someone who's left their window wide open. \n\nApplicable to any home or auto in any city, don't leave valuables in view. Never leave anything in your car, especially not visible. Use sheer curtains on your apartment windows so you can get sunlight during the day but the contents of your home aren't readily visible. Use opaque curtains or blinds at night and keep them closed. \n\nLike others have said for walking around, keep your head up, walk with purpose, one earbud or none so you can hear your surroundings, don't look lost, don't be staring at your phone while you walk. Just like home robberies, make yourself look like you wouldn't be an easy target. Make yourself look like someone who's going to see them coming and call attention to them. \n\nThis mostly applies at night, bc this isn't really a city where people are being attacked at all let alone during broad daylight. But do always be aware of your surroundings and follow your instincts.	13	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:20.999728+00	2025-05-03 23:56:20.999728+00	2025-05-03 02:32:32+00	f	mqb4n2m

Put bells on the door, and plants or small ceramics on the windows. Don’t leave keys, purses, wallets by the doors or windows. If you are staying there for a while, consider a security assessment done by an alarm company.\nMake sure your phone is charged always. Make sure people can’t see into your place with anything valuable visible. Especially at night. \n\nKnow your turf and where you can go for help in an emergency. Is there a convenience store located between your place and the public transportation you use? If you need to call 911, where you are is the most important then the situation. “I’m at 5th and Washington and a belligerent strange man is following me closely”.	6	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:21.007655+00	2025-05-03 23:56:21.007655+00	2025-05-03 02:47:36+00	f	mqb6w5x

There are random people walking around with mental illness or drug psychosis (I encountered one myself today.) Just give them space. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable, cross the street.\n\nThere are certain hotspots for drug activity (you’ll know it when you see one) so avoid those areas, especially after dark. Just use common sense and you should be fine. Despite our well documented fentanyl and homelessness crises, Portland remains a very safe city. You probably will see some disturbing shit now and again, but if you’re exercise reasonable caution, you are unlikely to come to any harm.\n\np.s. Welcome, we’re glad you’re here!

When I lived in a different, bigger city in my early 20s (I'm a small woman) I learned the best way to get around unbothered is to look mean, avoid eye contact, and walk with a purpose. Here, like others have said, most of the unwell folks who live on the streets are more unsettling than dangerous. Obviously not 100% true but as a rule of thumb, even someone who's behaving erratically isn't *usually* trying to bother you. Don't make eye contact and cross the street and they'll stay in their own world. \n\nTip #2 is absolutely to get to know your neighbors and be nice to them. Introduce yourself, offer kindness and support, and you'll have a good support network. \n\nTip #3 is to know where to go and where to avoid, and when. Every city is like this...., for example, don't walk around old town late at night alone if you're not looking for trouble. \n\nThe pearl is great btw! If you end up moving when your lease is up, look on the east side bc the neighborhoods are cuter, but for now, get your city sense and enjoy being within walking distance of great food, parks, and shopping.

Pepper spray is very effective for self defense and you wouldn’t have to live with the guilt of potentially killing someone. If you do want a gun, a classic shotgun kept in a safe is usually best for home defense. It’s pretty scary to people so more chance they would just back down/leave and you wouldn’t have to fire it. All that said, I have a home defense gun and carry pepper spray everyday and have never had to use either in any capacity. \n\nI’ve lived in the city my whole life (east side, not downtown, but I go to school/have worked downtown so I’ve spent a lot of time there) and have only had one break-in because I left the door unlocked. Car theft (either the actual vehicle or stuff from it) is more common. Not much you can do for that except keeping valuables out of the car, having good insurance (one that includes fixing broken windows), finding a place to park near a security camera or paying for a spot in a garage. \n\nAgree with others about moving with confidence. It helps a lot. I’m a small woman and have never had an altercation/scary situation beyond like… yelling and I attribute that to situational awareness and confidence. However, I would not recommend going out alone at night (especially if you are a woman). Daytime/with more people around you should be great. Downtown gets a bad rep but it’s pretty safe in most areas (in my experience). Just pay attention. Spend a day walking around to get a feel for different streets/areas.\n\nOverall, welcome to the city! It’s really a great place and you’ll get a feel for how to navigate it within a few months. \n\nEdit to add: if you do end up getting a gun, absolutely take several safety classes/lessons. If you have a gun in the home, learning how to properly store and handle it is non-negotiable.	1	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:21.119359+00	2025-05-03 23:56:21.119359+00	2025-05-03 11:10:24+00	f	mqcpsfj

Don't even look at them. If they ask you for a cigarette or $1, don't reply. Keep walking and ignore them.  There is zero chance that a stranger is going to interact with you in such a manner that the interaction will benefit you.  100% of the time they want something from you, regardless of what they say to you. \n\nThe only exception is if someone obviously and genuinely needs help, they're being attacked by a dog or whatever.	1	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:21.136449+00	2025-05-03 23:56:21.136449+00	2025-05-03 19:59:07+00	f	mqfam9h

I do not want one and it's not going to solve your problems (on the whole). Self defense classes are a good idea though. They'll teach you awareness.\n\nKeep your shit together, be aware of your surroundings, do not leave ANYTHING in your vehicle. Use common sense. Rinse and repeat.\n\nDowntown wasn't the best choice for you when you're this scared and lack city living experience. There are a lot of areas that are a better fit. Learn from this mistake and do more research so you're comfortable with where you live. YOLO is not a good reason to sign a lease when you are unsure of it.	0	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:21.142443+00	2025-05-03 23:56:21.142443+00	2025-05-03 01:35:53+00	f	mqavqez

I don't have specific store recommendations but there are tons of great maternity stuff that are vibrant and flowy or form fitting - honestly I was more comfortable wearing tight clothing when I was pregnant because I was like my midsection is supposed to be huge, show it off!

Portland has excellent metal, hardcore and punk scenes and if you want to move your body and get shit out to some loud angry music in a more intimate environment, there's a lot of good places to do it. 777 Booking is a cool promoter to check out, they have a few shows coming up, including this Sunday at Pallet Portland on SE Hawthorne.	4	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:46.643743+00	2025-05-04 01:31:06.238056+00	2025-05-03 15:05:05+00	f	mqdqh5r

I've had amazing experiences at nearly every venue I've been to in Portland, even the less savory places. \n\nWhat genre(s) do you prefer? Find a fan group who are super into their artist/band, then be prepared to be towards the front of the venue if you want to have some of that rub off on you.\n\nI doubt they'll be visiting anytime soon, but Stars is one of those bands for me. I went up to Vancouver to see them again last month. It's like a communal therapy session and their music provides a release. I know a lot of punk/hardcore and metal bands who scratch that itch as well.	3	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:46.655717+00	2025-05-04 01:31:06.245865+00	2025-05-03 15:27:15+00	f	mqduoiq

If these weren’t built then the gentrified neighborhoods would solely be redone cottage homes and ugly square modern homes that cost a million dollars. These allow residents of these areas to move into homes that are relatively less expensive then a single family house would be. I’ve seen 6-8 of these townhomes built on a SINGLE LOT, 8 people owning their own home for a reasonable price when there previously would’ve been one.\n\nI think people are just so caught up with the American dream of a white picket fence and a 4 bed house when that dream was never sustainable. People want less expensive housing costs but they also want a big single family home in a walkable neighborhood of a nice city with abundant parking and that just doesn’t go hand in hand. This is the closest thing to affordable single family homes that can be built right now in this area and people need to realize that concessions have to be made for that.	69	\N	2025-05-03 23:58:17.671842+00	2025-05-03 23:58:17.671842+00	2025-05-03 01:40:05+00	f	mqawewj

Theyre missing shit too. In my experience, every city has its own niche ways to find shows across a date range.\n\nDont get discouraged! Your tool rocks! I think move valuable than linking to my spotify (how lazy ARE we?) An automated venue submission for certain IPs (or basic,basic user access) would go much further in usefulness. If enough people start using it, and it takes less than 3 mins for a venue to be authed, then less than 2 mins for them to post the n3xt week of events, thats winning right there	3	\N	2025-05-03 23:51:54.165637+00	2025-05-04 01:26:14.403671+00	2025-05-03 04:05:18+00	f	mqbhswo

I was walking down 102nd Ave, and just crossed burnside and the MAX station. I get across and see cyclists, looked like maybe a mother and her teenage kid, were barreling down the sidewalk. So I moved to the right to get over as much as I could and slowed my pace.\n\nBut they just kept coming right at me.\n\nI stopped, and then the mother almost hits me, veering off to my right side, when my left side (Their right) was wide open with plenty of space to get around me. She starts yelling at me for being in the way and calling me homophobic slurs, which was appalling, but then the teenager following her, seemingly intentionally ran into me. It appeared that he leaned to his left off of his bike to setup and aim his shoulder to make direct contact to my chest.\n\nI was worried it was going to hurt, and I couldn't really dive out of the way because I have Degenerative Disc Disease and can't move like that.\n\nThe kid then directly shoulder checked me from his bike, but here's the amusing part of this story at least, he hit me and it didn't really hurt, or phase me. He just kind of bounced off and probably injured himself.\n\nBut they both stopped, after one nearly hit me, and the other hit me. The kid joined in on the homophobic slurs and blaming me for, "Being in the way". He then said something about my long hair and that I should cut it, and all kind of homophobic insults he was throwing at me in connection to it.\n\nIn anger I did end up telling him (As it's been a worry of mine, that this is something that is happening) that, "I hope you two go homeless and end up arrested, sent to prison for being poor, then you can end up as slaves again." (This is something I suspect and fear our current administration is trying to do with the homeless) But I want to point out I didn't mean it. It was in response to all of the hate filled stuff they were yelling at me, which didn't make sense, because they were the ones riding their bikes too fast on the side walk, and one of them assaulting me like that. My assumption is that was his mother and he was pissed because his mom almost hit me and saw her anger and frustration, which led to him acting in retaliation for her.\n\nIt all ended with me just yelling at them, "Share the sidewalk" over and over as they tried to have the last word with homophobic insults.\n\nAlso, I should point out, there was a bike lane. Not to mention the sidewalk in that portion of 102nd is about 6ft or more wide, they had tons of space to go left around me, but I think they were trying to go to my right, because they were trying to turn left at the crosswalk.\n\nBut still, bicyclists be crazy today. And looks like a similar case as this where the dude had just has no respect for bike rules or other people. Don't think it was a scam, just ignorance and assholery. But the SUV on the right there probably should have also been paying attention as you were.	3	\N	2025-05-03 23:54:41.082569+00	2025-05-04 01:29:01.916054+00	2025-05-03 06:54:34+00	f	mqc0lja

A complete &amp;  genuine nutter. An O.G. Portland weirdo.\n\nOne time he didn't like someone I was with. She was going to take it personally but I escorted us out of there quickly. Went back an hour later and he had no memory of us being there and was pleasant towards my friend, who ended up buying something.\n\nSometimes pals would balk at a ridonkulous asking price he'd toss out. I'd explain that we should leave and come back later. Every visit the price would go up or down, seemingly at random.\n\nOne time we left and came back three times in the same day. On the fourth visit he offered what my friend was willing to pay, which was about 1/3rd of his first ask.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with OP's post but that's my vintage shop story of the day.

Part of my job was repairing the endless vandalism of the loos downtown. In the cold, dark months, it could be a really shitty Sisyphean task. \n\nI remember one horrible morning when I had to rush from loo to loo, shutting off the water and draining them down to avoid catastrophic freeze damage. The once a year ice/ snow storm was rolling in, and I knew that everything I failed to drain would have to be completely rebuilt. My hands were numb from the cold. Inevitably the water I was draining would soak my gloves and the wind would blow over my wet freezing hands making everything painful and clumsy. Painful Clumsy is also a good name for a coffee house. \n\nAnyway. After I got the last, and worst loo drained down (it’s at 6th and Couch St. if memory serves) I went over to Deadstock Coffee. They were closing early, but I just made it in. I got my usual cappuccino. Occasionally the barista would use some sort of chocolate or cocoa dust and tap it over a little screen in the shape of an Air Jordan sneaker over the top of the cappuccino. Today she did. It was beautiful. And hot. And so rich. Very chocolate and smooth. I will never forget that contrast of misery and cold against the comfort and warmth of that cappuccino. That was a really great coffee. Try Deadstock.	5	\N	2025-05-03 23:55:16.228596+00	2025-05-04 01:29:27.676467+00	2025-05-03 16:28:27+00	f	mqe6exo

The connecting streets between them would also work but may have more cars activity. You'll most likely be fine in that area.

Very chill area. \n\nI wouldn't go along Dekum or North of it. I would avoid anywhere along the MLK blocks E or West for at least 5 blocks East up to and beyond Interstate.

They’ve helped me find jeans that fit like a dream, and sweaters that I never would have picked out for myself but end up loving.\n\nIf you go in and say, hey, I’m trying to get out of my monochromatic style and find some dresses and tops for summer, they’ll be happy to help you and pull some great pieces.\n\nThey’re not the most expensive, not the cheapest, but what I’ve gotten there has lasted through a lot of wear.	4	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:29.624464+00	2025-05-04 01:30:40.161764+00	2025-05-03 18:43:00+00	f	mqewss4

That’s definitely the case at David Bridal anyways. Sometimes they can even call other locations to see if they can find the right size for you sooner.\n\nBe very cautious of buying online. People will encourage it because then in theory you’re getting your exact size, but it can be hard on morale to find a dress that technically fits but doesn’t suit you at all. I would try to find it in person first and then look online if that fails.	3	\N	2025-05-03 23:56:55.58776+00	2025-05-04 01:30:49.516102+00	2025-05-03 22:33:31+00	f	mqg1rnn

Often in small venues, bc many of the bands not super well known. I would listen, note down songs you like, and find some affordable shows to attend. \nhttps://xray.fm/shows/alive-with-pleasure\n\nPrioritize checking out small venues, and figure out by experience what vibes you like the best. (I disagree with edgefield being any good, sadly, it’s more like an expensive and crowded festival unless you luck into a less sold-out show.)

But I do try to visit Spoke and Word bookstore most weekends. I feel like they made it through the slow business sitch that Milwaukie used to be and I hope they continue to grow now that things are picking up downtown. Milwaukie needs them!\n\nI’m currently (slowly) reading Under the Eye of the Big Bird. I’m really enjoying it - it’s eerie in a good way - but I don’t read short story collections quite as quickly as I do long form. I’m also reading Rhine Journey by Ann Schlee which is beautifully written historical fiction. I’m listening to The Secret Lives of Church Ladies which is wonderful and the narration is so well done.	2	\N	2025-04-30 00:08:43.251249+00	2025-05-05 04:28:14.217484+00	2025-04-29 23:43:38+00	f	mpr2by6

Zoning laws, slow permits, and neighborhood pushback make it hard to build, especially anything affordable.\n\nAt the same time, more people are moving here, wages haven’t kept up, and a lot of homes are getting scooped up as Airbnbs or investment properties instead of being rented or sold to locals.\n\nIt’s not one group’s fault, it’s just a system that hasn’t kept up with reality. Until we build more housing that regular people can actually afford, prices are gonna stay high and the homeless situation is going to get worse.	94	\N	2025-05-05 04:14:15.265365+00	2025-05-05 04:31:25.591377+00	2025-05-04 20:38:09+00	f	mqlh8lo

Except the people who did time in California and sold their house for a million bucks, they can live here, but not work here. Folks who came from Paradise California with insurance money can afford to move here, maybe open a business , but they can't find workers. Jobs only pay 18 bucks an hour if you are lucky, most are service jobs. Nobody can afford to hire people who have to get paid enough to live here. \n\nBut honestly, having an AirBnB every 4th house means neighborhoods and the best part about small town living, the part that makes the low wages worth it, having close neighbors you can depend on, that is dead and gone. My neighborhood is strangers mostly. The other houses that you could raise a family in have 1 or 2 people, retired. Payed 800k 5 years ago. Meanwhile the local mill pays 18 bucks an hour. \n\nThis is the reality for a working age male. How much better is it for the people who worked at that same mill in the 70s and retired and don't have enough  money to stay? They live in the bushes, so we cut the bushes down. That's how it's working out for old people in Southern Oregon.	17	\N	2025-05-05 04:14:15.269159+00	2025-05-05 04:31:25.595381+00	2025-05-04 21:54:46+00	f	mqlvoy3

It’s spring so it’s hooting season. You can generally find them in the oldest tallest tree when they hoot, as they look for a mate! Super hard to spot when they are up in the tree. Their hoot is also extremely deceiving. It takes a lot of practice to pinpoint where it comes from. If you get good enough at hooting the male might come down and chirp at you for trying to take its mate!

The parking situation is pretty bad but nowhere near the worst in Portland. The houses don't have driveways and you can imagine the type of people that can afford to live there tend to own more than one car. Kind of funny to see so higher-end cars forced to park on the street and covered in leaves. Some of the little diagonal streets are hypothetical 2 lanes but feel quite crowded when there's rows of cars on both sides.	6	\N	2025-05-05 04:15:37.573632+00	2025-05-05 04:32:45.636919+00	2025-05-04 05:30:48+00	f	mqhq2mo

Multnomah Art Center, the JCC, PCC Sylvania, and the SW Community Center have a lot going on. Very solid neighborhood association to become involved in to influence the City. You can look on the US Census for demographics, and precinct election results on politics. That will show mid-upper middle class voting blue with young families and elderly, few 20-something hipsters/influencers whatever those terms mean.	10	\N	2025-05-05 04:15:54.310954+00	2025-05-05 04:33:03.897425+00	2025-05-04 16:44:21+00	f	mqk7lk8

Once you get out to places like Battle Ground and Camas it gets much more conservative. That’s the land of Y’all Qaeda, Gravy Seals and MAGATS.

Ultimately I think it depends on what area of Vancouver you're looking at, the city itself is really spread out and surprisingly diverse for what is essentially considered a suburb of Portland. Areas like Downtown and Hazel Dell tend to be pretty chill and laid back but if you move North-East you're pushing closer to Brush Prairie/Battle Ground which tends to be pretty conservative. As someone who grew up in Vancouver and remembered it as being very welcoming and calm I really hate hearing how downhill its gone.	0	\N	2025-05-05 04:16:37.336571+00	2025-05-05 04:33:45.475151+00	2025-05-04 20:08:52+00	f	mqlbk00

Back in the 80s and 90s, they were getting pretty scarce and got designated as "endangered", but after years of conservation efforts and banning the use of DDT they were upgraded to "threatened" and finally, now, their conservation status is classified as "least concern".

I just went on a walk around the area to see if I could spot or hear her, and I'll continue to help search whenever I can. If possible, I've heard leaving out items like blankets or a bed that you know your cat really likes can help bring them back since it smells like home, so maybe that's something to try if you haven't already! I really really hope that old man doesn't have your cat and is just being a grump for some reason	1	\N	2025-05-05 04:19:44.311189+00	2025-05-05 04:36:51.947817+00	2025-05-05 03:10:40+00	f	mqnc672

Though they could be better, they aren’t controlled by schools - get into your neighborhood and talk to parents about getting their kids to school. \n2 - Educators in BSD ARE very upset the superintendent wasn’t given an annual review that included their feedback. Go to the school board meetings and listen to what the many teachers have expressed during public comments. \n\nI hope you, OP, are attending school board meetings and raising these points, in addition to speaking to your friends and neighbors about this.	27	\N	2025-05-05 04:20:09.742998+00	2025-05-05 04:37:18.674835+00	2025-05-05 02:15:30+00	f	mqn3kgc

But for the size of organization he oversees, he is paid far less than the private industry.  I imagine benefits are better, but probably not enough to close the gap.\nAs for the reviews.  They are a sham anyway.  I assume those reviews aren't made public for all to see.  If so, they mean nothing.  And frankly, most teachers probably don't have enough context to review the person.  Surveys of staff about what us going right and what is going wrong, which could be made public, would be of far more value.  And similarly, could be used as a review of his leadership.  But doing those surveys is hard to do in a way that can't be manipulated.	4	\N	2025-05-05 04:20:09.747166+00	2025-05-05 04:37:18.678885+00	2025-05-05 03:59:46+00	f	mqnj53d

Housing and businesses.  There are no such things as affordable housing and mom and pop businesses anymore.  They're all being bought out.  PE is using algorithms to drive up housing prices and raise rents.  It's out of control.  \n\nIt's not only housing.  Grocery stores and markets, dental practices, veterinary offices, mortuaries and nursing homes.  These used to be owned and run by your neighbors in small towns.  Now there are offers they can't refuse coming in, especially if they have debt.  PE firms then hire the cheapest people who are often under qualified.  They cut staff, cut hours and overwork whoever is left.  Those people feel "lucky" to still have jobs.  They start up-selling services you don't need.  \n\nYou end up paying higher prices and going into debt.  Otherwise, you can't afford the care that you, your pets, your elderly parents and your deceased loved one should have so you do without or you scrimp on things as much as possible.\n\nPrivate equity is killing us for shareholder profits.  Social safety nets and public health initiatives are being defunded.  There was never enough support for people who end up homeless so that's just getting worse.

They want you to keep filing because if you receive the payouts or not they continue to decrease your overall total benefit each time. For example they jacked me around last fall when I applied for benefits; I had over $18,000 in my available unemployment funds at the beginning. They did the same thing to me but had denied my benefits still required me to file weekly and the hidden requirement that you actually have to go to Worksource and complete their online application and assessment in order to qualify which also includes in person identification verification. At the end of 4 months with no pay and honestly a TON of hassle with Unemployment for nothing - Worksource sent me an employment offer in February but I wouldn’t have been hired until mid to late March (I had been unemployed since November). I literally started my own business in the meantime. I am a person with a masters in clinical mental health counseling who received a scholarship from Worksource the last term of graduate school. The system is certainly broken, at the end, my $18,000 of benefits I had accrued through working dual employment (at times triple employment) was completely drained due to their requirement to file ongoing claims whether receiving benefits or not. Total hoax. It’s a federal government program.	-2	\N	2025-05-05 04:15:14.168261+00	2025-05-05 04:32:23.951788+00	2025-05-04 15:25:59+00	f	mqjsfo8

For straightforward fish and chips you cannot beat Luna Sea in Yachats.  I think it is the best place on the Oregon coast for fried fish.

It adds some character and gives the neighborhood a sense of place not enjoyed by other similarly-dense neighborhoods. The irregular street pattern slows down cars, making it quieter and more pedestrian and bike friendly. The absence of curb cuts for driveways contributes to this too! \n\nThe short blocks and irregular intersections reduce long sight lines, which makes the neighborhood feel more intimate. \n\nGreen space is nicely integrated into the neighborhood design, which promotes community interaction and provides *some* ecological value. \n\n**Cons:** \n\nThe radial layout is disorienting and wayfinding can be difficult. \n\nThe diagonal streets create irregular lot shapes (often triangular) which can be hard to build on efficiently. In the current planning context, this means limited infill potential, or reduced housing density compared to a standard rectilinear grid. \n\nMany of the diagonal streets don’t align with the external network, creating awkward intersections and points of congestion / confusion. \n\n\n\nI’d love to see better signage to help with navigation (especially for cyclists) and green spaces that provide more significant ecological services (stormwater retention areas, pollinator corridors, etc.).	7	\N	2025-05-05 04:15:37.608989+00	2025-05-05 04:32:45.672814+00	2025-05-04 10:50:55+00	f	mqilzku

I (straight white male) grew up in a smallish but very liberal town and it still caught me off guard the first few times I saw PDA from gay couples, even though I didn't think of myself as the slightest bit homophobic.  Similarly, growing up in a pretty white area, even while not thinking I was racist at all, when I moved to Minneapolis at 18 and suddenly had black friends it took me awhile to shake the idea they were different, just because I hadn't had exposure to many people of other races. After a few months I felt like an idiot for even feeling that way to begin with.

You will want to look for one that has an IDD license. If your loved one has a case manager through Multnomah County IDD department, they can assist you with the placement search. There are actually way more IDD-licensed homes than there is demand for them right now, so there are a lot of options   \n\nhttps://www3.multco.us/AdultCareOptions/\n\nI work in the APD side, not IDD, so I can't name any great IDD homes off the top of my head. As with any system, there are some crappy homes, some decent homes, and some amazing homes.	4	\N	2025-05-05 04:17:48.914291+00	2025-05-05 04:34:58.382471+00	2025-05-04 18:47:21+00	f	mqkw4ix

Same last name but didn’t know her super well and didn’t run in remotely the same circles, so I never clocked who she was. All I knew about her was she was the type of person to try and pierce her ears in a bathroom with a thumb tack. One afternoon though I went over to my girlfriend’s parents house, before we headed out to a soccer game, they had TV news  on, and they were showing Amanda coming back, exiting a plane. Her family was with her and I recognized her sister and was like wtf how did I never know.	68	\N	2025-05-05 04:18:27.569271+00	2025-05-05 04:35:36.628656+00	2025-05-04 17:43:11+00	f	mqkjhlv

My boyfriend has a 9 year old female dog who is a sweetheart and gets along with EVERYONE and is patient and forgiving when meeting new dogs. I have a lot of experience with dog psychology and training and living with high energy herding breeds. I’m walking distance to the beach and there’s someone home a lot for cuddles and interaction. We also go outside adventuring a LOT and have family close with land and have dog play dates  there often where they can run around and get their energy out. I would love to meet her if you are interested in looking a little outside Portland for a potential home! 💕💕	31	\N	2025-05-05 04:19:26.854134+00	2025-05-05 04:36:35.87838+00	2025-05-05 01:14:13+00	f	mqmtir0

Hello last night I just found out that me and my grandma have an eviction notice and are supposed to be out by the 23rd of next month. This is the most scared I’ve been and I genuinely have no clue what to do. Some things to note: I started a gofundme and made a few tiktoks to try and promote it but nothing more than a few hundred views. My grandma is not employed (since 2020) her mom died and is dealing with major depression and a drug addiction. I am employed but due to poor scheduling I’ve been scheduled once a week for the past month. I have 2k in savings. No drivers license. No diploma. Not many options housing wise, just my mom but I would only go to her as a last resort (untreated bipolar/schizophrenia). I don’t have much real world experience. I don’t want to leave my grandma all alone either but I feel like it might have to be the case. I have about 7 cats to also worry about if we don’t figure out a solution. The debt is almost 13k. That’s about all, sorry for such a shitty post. I’ll be willing to answer more questions if needed, I’m struggling with a lot right now, even considered ending it all last night. Words of advice, resources or any stories of your own would help. Thank you for even reading this.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1jo3qrq/19_with_an_eviction_notice_what_to_do/	97	49	/r/askportland/comments/1jo3qrq/19_with_an_eviction_notice_what_to_do/	2025-04-01 06:30:43.999353+00	2025-04-01 06:30:43.999353+00	2025-03-31 13:54:35+00	f	f	text	0	0	{00,bill,mail,testimony,just,amp,https,today,oregonlegislature,gov}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I don’t know how to write this without sounding dramatic, but everything’s fallen apart and I’m out of ideas.\n\nI moved to La Pine after my boyfriend Kevin died. He was the love of my life — my person — and losing him wrecked me. We had two cats together, and now it’s just me and Dax. He was Kevin’s baby. I already had to give our other cat away and I can’t do that to Dax. He’s all I have left of our little family.\n\nI ended up in Oregon because I had nowhere else to go. I’m staying with my dad and his girlfriend, and it’s been constant fighting, yelling, meth use — I don’t feel safe here, and honestly I don’t think I’m okay anymore. I’m not working. I don’t have money. I don’t have friends here. I don’t have anyone in the whole state, really. I’m queer and grieving and losing my grip on everything, including myself.\n\nI need help. I need somewhere safe to go — even short-term — where Dax and I can breathe. Somewhere queer-friendly. Somewhere I don’t have to hide my grief or who I am. I can trade work, cleaning, house-sitting, pet-sitting — anything. I’m an artist too — I paint and customize furniture, weird little pieces, memorial stuff. I’m willing to do whatever it takes.\n\nIf you know of anyone — even outside Portland — who has a room, a cabin, a guest house, a corner of a safe place… please message me. Or just say hi. I’m trying to hold on, but I can’t do this completely alone.\n\nThanks for reading.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1jvxz4b/im_lost_in_oregon_after_my_partner_died_just/	301	38	/r/askportland/comments/1jvxz4b/im_lost_in_oregon_after_my_partner_died_just/	2025-04-11 03:33:18.784929+00	2025-04-12 01:09:12.495742+00	2025-04-10 13:31:23+00	f	f	text	377	3	{dog,yard,water,one,put,park,per,whoever,tiny,rest}	\N	\N	\N	\N

As a decentralized chapter, we remain steadfast in our commitment to organizing and building a stronger, more just community. \n\nMovements like ours, built on passion and high stakes, have always been targets for bad actors who try to co-opt or sabotage what we’re building. We are not immune, and we are staying vigilant. We want to be clear: we will persist in our efforts to mobilize, advocate, and fight for the rights and dignity of all individuals. \n\n50501 Portland’s mission is to mobilize and connect our communities to ensure the safety and voice of the people. Since the beginning, we’ve proven — with every action — that we are a force to be reckoned with and a real threat to entrenched systems of power. This is a movement about power: reclaiming it and redistributing it to the people.\n\nChallenging that power comes with inherent risk.\nWe want to make our community aware of the dangers posed by individuals who may call an event without proper safety or planning. We are committed to combating that by making sure we put in the hard work and organizing to make these mass protests as intentional and safe as we possibly can. Our route planning, Corkers, Medics, and De-escalation teams are dedicated fully to minimizing the risks we all face exercising our first amendment rights. \n\nBecause we want this movement to have longevity, and to protect our people, we remain vigilant about potential threats.\n\nAnyone can organize under the 50501 umbrella or claim to represent 50501.  As such, our internal Organization team goes through a strict security vetting process.  Different responsibilities are assigned to individuals on our team based on the level of safety they can provide, and trainings they have attended.  For example:\n\n-Our medics are professionally accredited\n\n\n-Our safety and de-escalation coordinators are community-trusted and trained\n\n\n[b]Our record is awesome,[/b] and our methods speak for themselves. Here’s what we’ve done so far:\n\n2/17 - No President’s day, our first action in the community at Portland City Hall in Downtown Portland.\n\n3/15 - Protect our Public Lands march from City Hall and around down town. We marched nearly 10,000 people for our first major land March.\n\n4/5 - Hands Off! Our most successful event yet where nearly 30,000 of us amassed at the Japanese Historical Plaza and crossed two major bridges at once.\n\n4/19 - Earth Day Land march with nearly 10,000 people at Pioneer Courthouse Square.\n\nWe love you, and will keep doing our thing, so you can keep doing yours. Thanks for being a part of this incredible movement, it’d be nothing without all of you. \n\nOur next event is sure to be even better with all the great support we've received from you, our community.\n\n&lt;b&gt;Next event:&lt;/b&gt;\n\n5/1 Mayday - International Workers Day in the South Parkblocks from 1 - 5\n\n&lt;b&gt;Connect with us on Our Socials: &lt;/b&gt;\n\nReddit: r/50501PDX\nInstagram: @50501PortlandOr\nFacebook: 50501 Portland Oregon\nBluesky: @pdxoregon50501.bsky.social\nTikTok: @pdx50501movement\nJoin us on Discord!\n\nStay vigilant.

BSD Superintendent to make $.5 million	Recently BSD asked the public to recommend ways to cut $30 million from the budget. At the same time, educators and Beaverton tax-payers successfully lobbied the School Board to delay the approval of Superintendent Balderas’ contract. With his new contract unchecked, he would continue to receive an annual raise of 10% and his salary would be ~$500,000 for the 2025-2026 school year. \n\nIs anyone else concerned that the School Board, chaired by School Board candidate Dr. Pérez-Dasilva, has never subjected the superintendent to an annual review? Additionally, is anyone else concerned that the Board is allowing him to submit a self-evaluation as the sole evidence of success before contract renewal? I don’t know of any other profession in which somebody could make half a million dollars without ever being evaluated by someone else, especially when finances are a huge concern. \n\nBSD’s attendance rates are still abysmal, a crowd of 800+ educators laughed when the chair announced a Forbes’ Best Places to Work award, BSD cannot retain teachers of color, class sizes still near 30 in many elementary schools and 40 to 50 at middle and high schools, many classified staff are paid so poorly that they qualify for SNAP benefits, reading and math scores remain near the bottom in the nation, and we do not have enough paraeducators to support our students with the highest needs. Our district is still funding redundant leadership positions at the central office, many of which come with salaries over $170k, we have 7 staff dedicated to public relations, and have plans to spend $650k on Student Resource Officers in the upcoming school year. (Most school districts’ SROs are paid through the city, but our current school board agreed to fund the program with the school budget.) None of this is going to show up in his self-evaluation. \n\nIf you are concerned, like I am, what can we do? 	https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/1kex8kn/anyone_else_concerned_bsd_superintendent_to_make/	42	12	/r/beaverton/comments/1kex8kn/anyone_else_concerned_bsd_superintendent_to_make/	2025-05-05 04:20:09.738361+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 23:14:35+00	f	f	text	66	28	{school,board,bsd,public,else,concerned,superintendent,review,schools,aren}	\N	\N	\N	\N

We tuned in last night at 11 pm stunned to hear Anthony Valadez's voice (don't get me wrong, we live in LA and we love Anthony Valadez, but he's a KCRW DJ and they talk SO MUCH compared to KMHD DJs) and there's no mention of why the Joint's gone on their website.

Your mileage may of course certainly vary.\n\nIt was definitely cleaner and the homeless numbers were at their lowest from like 2010-2019, but that's also when cheap &amp; shared housing started to disappear as all the glass condos sprouted up. The Pearl was seen as optimum Portland.  Dive bars with well drinks were mostly cleared out for twee spaces, with expensive, curated cocktails. Restaurant groups started to conglomerate and exert power over the dining scene, applying upscale pressure. "Cheap bar food" disappeared almost entirely as bar kitchens started to blur the line between "real" restaurant dining. Retail spots were filled more and more with luxe-chains rather than anything local and quirky. Almost all of Portland's 'third spaces' shifted from funky and random, repurposed spaces to places purpose-built to deliver very particular and targeted vibes.\n\n2010-2019 Pre-Covid Portland was practically devoid of grit, and while I certainly have many strong complaints about Portland's current state, getting back to the antiseptic, bougie Portland of 10 years ago is practically as unattractive to me, as staying in our current conditions.	https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1ka3xh2/portland_10_years_ago/	324	192	/r/Portland/comments/1ka3xh2/portland_10_years_ago/	2025-04-29 16:21:43.257473+00	2025-04-29 16:24:26.016886+00	2025-04-28 19:15:04+00	f	f	text	708	4	{portland,think,era,old,cheap,10,years,ago,back,started}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I am a little newer to Portland, moved here in 2022. I'm curious if there is a law in place limiting maximum concert volume. I first got curious after my first few shows here because they just seemed overall quieter than I was expecting.\n\nAt one point, at Crystal Ballroom (pretty sure it was there, an Oh Sees show, I think?) I noticed a decibel meter display near the soundboard, which hovered very closely to 100 the entire time. I've since noticed that meter display at other venues and haven't seen anything above 100, really.\n\nThe clincher for me to even post this was Mogwai last night- it got to about 106 dB max, and only when I was in line with a speaker array. I have seen them elsewhere many times before and those shows blew my socks off. Not saying it was a bad show (Roseland Theater being awful aside), they are always good, just was hoping for just a bit more. I use the NIOSH sound level meter app and while that may not be terribly accurate (?), it has closely tracked with the meters I see in use at places.\n\nI love a very loud show from time to time, not ear-piercing but that stomach-rumbling presence that venue PAs can produce. I have been craving that and haven't yet been satisfied. I looked at the [city code for noise](https://www.portland.gov/code/18/all), but that seems to be about general neighborhood noise, etc, not anything specific to nightclubs/venues. \n\nWhat's going on here? Is someone out there looking out for me and my ears who I'll thank in 20 years? Is it some occupational rule for a safe workplace for the venue staff? (I'd support that, even if I wish my experience was different). Or a state or county regulation going on?\n\nI know in the past 10-15 years venues in many cities have gotten more serious about volume. I also record music and protecting my ears is important to me, but the sensory experience of feeling frozen in time from sheer volume is also quite special too (it doesn't need to be dangerous, decent earplugs can preserve the sound while keeping your ears safe). OR maybe I have gotten old and my ears and body aren't what they used to be. OR something. I dunno.\n\nCurious if there are any sound/venue staff or musicians here who can tell me if I'm onto something or if I'm making it all up. Just don't tell me that the Sunn O))) show here I missed had that brown note or whatever it is i'm looking for going on...	https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1k9d555/is_there_a_concertclub_maximum_decibel_ordinance/	2	21	/r/Portland/comments/1k9d555/is_there_a_concertclub_maximum_decibel_ordinance/	2025-04-28 05:55:44.75469+00	2025-04-28 06:38:30.1705+00	2025-04-27 20:07:04+00	f	f	text	44	42	{noise,show,time,not,portland,just,sound,going,ears,experience}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I am not asking you to trust me as an authority of 50501. In fact I am asking for you to turn your trust back towards your local organizations. 50501 in its original form was meant to be a call to action to the people by the people to support our constitutional governance. In the process of coordinating these protests, local communities within the states have formed strong relations that I have the utmost faith can coordinate the peoples future self advocacy. \n\nThe following are my suggestions to the community moving forward. \n\nAs a concept 50501 is not subject to ownership. The concept is that we all show up, at all 50 states, at each of the 50 state capitols in the solidarity of our support of our most basic human rights. \n\nNo one in this community has the authority to tell you what days you can or cannot protest as long as it is organized through the proper legal channels. \n\nNo one in this community has the right to tell you you don't have the authority to organize a protest as directed by the first amendment in the spirit of 50501. If you would like to form a community then do so. \n\nWe must participate in the democracy we wish to live in. This means our continued participation in elections, this means running for office on any level, this means civil discourse and exercising our first amendment rights. \n\n50501 does not win by outcompeting supportive movements. There are so many great communities already in place to find your voice and they need our support. \n\nWe must expect ourselves and our leaders to embody the ideals we wish for our society. This means remaining civil when we use our voice in our public spaces and when organizing we do so in a conscious and informed manner. If a leader does not act in accord with the core ideals of a society they are not representative of the will of the people and should not be followed. \n\n\nI believe that this is the best path forward if you agree, please share this message. \n\n\n\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/50501PDX/comments/1k9efyb/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	18	0	/r/50501PDX/comments/1k9efyb/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	2025-04-28 02:43:53.19896+00	2025-04-28 06:38:30.1705+00	2025-04-27 21:03:29+00	f	f	text	18	63	{50501,not,community,post,means,message,authority,people,support,50}	\N	\N	\N	\N

We moved here from a red state. It took forever to find a house and we had to go higher than our price range but we finally got something in inner SE. we closed at the start of March. \n\nSince closing we’ve gotten a bill from the city for $2500 for a bush they claim was overgrown over the sidewalk. It was maybe 2 inches too grown. we finally got copies of the previous notices from the last home owner and he let it get extremely overgrown but he had it trimmed before putting the house on the market. We were not given an opportunity to take care of it. The city finally agreed to drop their fees and we only had to pay the $400 they apparently paid someone to trim a bush \n\nNow they’re here tearing up our sidewalk. Claimed they gave notice about that. I can’t imagine how much this is going to cost. Our house is on a corner and they’ve torn up at least 4 big blocks of concrete so far. The sidewalk was not egregiously messed up or dangerous. There was slight unevenness but nothing extreme. It honestly feels like they’re targeting our house \n\nAccording to neighbors the last owner let the house go and everyone seemed really upset about it. So I think lots of nosy neighbors called in to the city about the house. But they didn’t do anything about it until we bought it. Nothing showed up on PortlandMaps about this when we bought the house \n\nI just feel like — what the actual fuck?! Is this how the city welcomes newcomers? We spent all our money buying this house and doing work inside and now we’re being blindsided \n\nI read that the city charged someone $20k for their sidewalk so I’m really freaking out \n\nIs there anything we can do??	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9zr24/has_anyone_else_been_charged_egregiously_by_the/	68	95	/r/askportland/comments/1k9zr24/has_anyone_else_been_charged_egregiously_by_the/	2025-04-29 16:20:19.470248+00	2025-04-29 16:24:26.016886+00	2025-04-28 16:25:21+00	f	f	text	258	13	{city,house,sidewalk,new,not,go,finally,bush,owner,let}	\N	\N	\N	\N

But now it's in great shape once again.  \n  \nElsewhere, a shot up abandoned pickup truck was dragged out to the roadway where DNR can get it hauled off (video in the comments on TNL's Facebook page).  Lots of stuff happened all over the forest yesterday and it was all good.  Still hearing about other's adventures.\n\nNext up is North Fork Wolf Creek shooting lanes, May 17th.

This is a spacious 2nd-floor apartment featuring a patio with trees for shade, vaulted ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace, an in-unit washer/dryer, and on-site amenities such as two pools, two hot tubs, a gym, and covered parking.\n\nThe room:\n\nThe room is the “2nd bedroom” which means you will have access to the guest bathroom as well. The room is carpeted, while the rest of the apartment is not. The room has a closet with built-in shelving and a small patio area attached to it. \n\nAbout me\n\nI am a 42-year-old gay male who works from home. I have a stable income and have worked in the banking industry for over 20 years. When not working, I enjoy doing a decent amount of gaming, cooking, going for walks, and watching TV marathons. I do have a partner who will visit and stay the night every other weekend. As far as pets, I have none, but I am open to you having pets. Let’s discuss this. I would say I am a mix of introvert and extrovert; I can enjoy talks and chatting, but I can also be just as happy sequestered in my room. \n\nAbout you\n\nI am very open-minded about what I am looking for in a roommate. My biggest concern is that you have a stable income. You will need to add yourself to the lease (lease is from June 1 2025 - May 31, 2026) I am open to having a roommate who has pets or even roommates who are a couple (we would need to discussing splitting the rent if that’s the case.) however no kids sorry. Also, please respect the common spaces and help keep them clean. \n\nRent is 1000/month (includes, water, garbage, parking) + utilities (internet and electricity) \n\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ken53s	1	0	/r/FindPortlandRoommate/comments/1ken53s/room_opening_in_hillsboro/	2025-05-05 04:09:31.189352+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 15:56:49+00	f	f	text	1	73	{room,roommate,apartment,will,pets,open,hillsboro,looking,bedroom,area}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Since getting into Oregon, I've seen more OSP officers than I *ever* saw CHP officers in my 30-ish years of living in California.

I was lucky in that my local liquor store has a running list for customers wanting Blanton’s, and she has been able to make it through the list every month, so this month, she opted to stock one on the shelf every couple of days.

One of the things that has drawn me to Cascadia in general is that I have a lot more pride in my area than I do with either party in power when it comes to identifying with a group. My personal opinion is that WA/OR (and Idaho, but they fall on the other side politically so this post is less about them) gets taken for granted A LOT by the national Democrats - our states were greatly impacted by homelessness/BLM protests/COVID, and watching Democrat leaders waste money, have scandal after scandal, and still get voted in comfortably because Republicans don’t align with the bulk of the voters is maddening. \n\nI would love a future where the Cascadian party had representation in Congress. Voting as a consistent Democrat has done nothing for us - why shouldn’t we clearly tell the rest of the country that we make our own choices? If it’s not good for us, why should any one party be entitled to our votes? \n\nExample: in Oregon, over a third of our population lives rurally. There are some MAJOR issues (healthcare access, jobs, education) that impact such a large part of population that don’t get recognition and support needed on the national scale because it’s so polarizing at the top that politics has devolved into single issues winning elections and policy is so narrow - Boeing/Nike/Intel are all going to suffer and impact us because Michigan misses manufacturing jobs?! What? I want a representative that is clear that they are there to represent our people and we aren’t tied to one party, because quite frankly we don’t get enough out of constantly sticking our neck out for them. \n\nAm I crazy? I know I am rambling, but our numbers in Congress are VITAL because this country is so split - I know it’s heresy, but what have the Democrats really done for us recently? Why shouldn’t we identify uniquely, and just advocate solely for ourselves? \n\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/1kavdqu/is_there_any_future_as_a_political_party_to/	31	46	/r/Cascadia/comments/1kavdqu/is_there_any_future_as_a_political_party_to/	2025-04-29 23:33:02.615314+00	2025-04-30 00:09:45.53351+00	2025-04-29 18:36:25+00	f	f	text	123	0	{party,cascadia,us,needs,first,children,free,national,one,don}	\N	\N	\N	\N

And get involved with a sort of community with shared ideals and learn ways to help. \n\nAre there any specific Buddhist temples that would be good for someone who only speaks English and is new to everything?

I am new to cycling got my bike last September and rode a lot until the weather got bad. Was feeling bold... Signed up for the 1 day STP with zero experience in cycling, group riding and so on... Since about the beginning of April I have been training aggressively on the weekends and casual riding during the week. Today I did my longest ride of 60 miles around Portland averaging 16.2 mph (Moving time). I know around town some of the areas are stop and go which kind of lowers your pace. But about 80% of the time I was in Zone 4 while pushing myself. By the end of it, my thighs were dead. I did have my snacks, water bottles I refilled multiple times at coffee shops with electrolytes. From the suggestions I have seen, people say to "pace yourself" How in the world is it even possible to average 17-20 mph while not destroying yourself. All recommendations I have seen is to be in Zone 2-3 most of the time riding STP. This borderline seems impossible??? If you are with a group and are drafting is it that much easier? I would like to train with someone out there who has at least some experience. I will continue on training hard on the weekends either way! Overall I think I will still do it! I will simply call my wife to pick me up if I feel I cannot finish but just looking for the best advice and also someone to ride with around Portland!

We are looking to paint the exterior of our 1890s Queen Anne Victorian here in Portland. We will need some light restoration work, too. We are willing to pay for top-notch work. Our home is 5 colors, lots of detailed trim, and very tall.\n\nHave you had your historic home painted? What company did you use?

What questions were you happy you asked when getting the quote? \n\nSo far, we are thinking of contacting the following painting companies:\n\nWeinmann Painting\n\nSFW Painting\n\nMountain Painting\n\nI've chose these 3 because of their apparent focus on old home restoration, but I am happy to hear recommendations for other companies.\n\nthanks in advance for any wisdom you have!\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1ka9y9i/who_painted_your_historic_portland_home/	12	8	/r/askportland/comments/1ka9y9i/who_painted_your_historic_portland_home/	2025-04-29 16:21:10.499335+00	2025-04-29 16:24:26.016886+00	2025-04-28 23:35:28+00	f	f	text	28	48	{paint,historic,home,painting,job,painted,restoration,work,colors,weinmann}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I realize this place may be long gone...\n\nI've lived in OR for 10+ years (in the Gorge), but before we moved here from out of state, I came to scope out Portland on a week long vacation. This would have been around 2013, give or take half a year. On that trip, we ate at a restaurant somewhere in the NW quadrant (not a NW neighborhood, the wider NW quadrant) that I'd love to track down if it still exists.\n\nIt would have been showing up on a lot of Portland's best-of lists at the time, since everywhere we went was pretty heavily researched. Wouldn't have been an obscure spot. What I remember most about it is that it was in more of a hilly, forested natural area, not an urban neighborhood. More like the feel around the zoo, Forest Park, Pittock Mansion. It may have been a suburb, but I don't think it was a very far drive (we were staying NE). We sat on a patio with an outdoorsy view, which may or may not have been enclosed. The menu had seafood, probably not strictly seafood, more like your standard PNW fare. Not fine dining, not fancy, but nice. Very good food. The building may have been a house at one point, had a homey feel, not industrial or modern.\n\nSince we live in the Gorge, I'm still a tourist in Portland. I come into the city often on weekenders to explore, but my memory is totally failing me about where this place might have been. Anyone have guesses?\n\nUpdate - SOLVED. I'm almost positive we were in the sunroom at Seasons &amp; Regions.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9bq62/help_identify_a_restaurant_i_went_to_10_years_ago/	24	54	/r/askportland/comments/1k9bq62/help_identify_a_restaurant_i_went_to_10_years_ago/	2025-04-28 02:12:43.869143+00	2025-04-28 06:38:30.1705+00	2025-04-27 19:06:24+00	f	f	text	132	18	{not,nw,may,portland,10,went,years,long,quadrant,neighborhood}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Hi, Ive been trying to figure out the best option for phone service that I can use in nature settings.

Looking for some advice.\n\nI’m currently deciding between a school in Colorado ( boulder ) and one in Oregon ( u of o ). I will be studying business administration so they are comparable. \n\nHere is where I am conflicted. I am definitely leaning towards boulder. But I have a condition called dry eye ( more specifically MGD ). I am worried about the climate in Boulder ie the sun/dry air/indoor heat in the winter. These could potentially make my eyes feel worse.\n\nWhen visiting boulder my eyes definitely felt worse, Oregon made them feel a bit better.\n\nAny general advice for what to do? I’m having to make this big decision by May 1st. I really don’t want to miss out on boulder but I would hate to have my eyes be a big issue. ( I’m already doing all the right protocols and they are manageable but still problematic )\n\nI am coming from California, has anyone made a climate change like this with dry eye or any climate change in general? What was it like? \n\nThanks in advance!	https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1kah24i/boulder_vs_oregon_help_needed/	0	7	/r/oregon/comments/1kah24i/boulder_vs_oregon_help_needed/	2025-04-29 16:18:05.457279+00	2025-04-29 16:24:26.016886+00	2025-04-29 06:09:29+00	f	f	text	14	60	{boulder,oregon,dry,climate,eyes,condition,feel,advice,definitely,eye}	\N	\N	\N	\N

She's a fully accredited dog trainer and built this course over several years in order to save new dog owners money. Hiring a private trainer for your pup normally costs $100+ per hour and taking them to puppy preschool is typically $150 for 6 classes that just go over the basics (sit, stay etc.). Not to mention if you want to take your dog to the more advanced classes after puppy preschool it's hundreds more. She made this course so she can spend time with her pups whilst still helping people train their dogs.\n\nAdrienne teaches everything covered there in this one course so you can teach your pup in the comfort of your own home, at your own pace and for a fraction of the price. The best part is, she works with you as you teach your pup, you can reach out to her whenever you run into any issues and she'll help. So you still get the 1 on 1 expert opinion that you'd get from a private trainer, all you have to do is send her an explanation or video of the problem you're trying to address or issues in teaching that you're having.\n\nDelete this post if it's not allowed but I just thought this might help some new dog parents :)\n\n[Link here to check out the training program](http://braintraining4pups.com)	https://www.reddit.com/r/PDX/comments/1ka27xi/you_should_try_this_if_youre_getting_a_pup_any/	0	0	/r/PDX/comments/1ka27xi/you_should_try_this_if_youre_getting_a_pup_any/	2025-04-29 16:11:50.887173+00	2025-04-29 16:24:26.016886+00	2025-04-28 18:05:05+00	f	f	text	0	79	{dog,pup,re,trainer,course,time,training,years,new,private}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Thank you	Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently trying to choose between two schools in the Portland area for my child: the German International School (GIS) and The International School (TIS), for chinese track. I’ve heard many good things about both and feel confident about the academic quality at each.\n\nI really care about finding a place where my child can continue to grow their curiosity, love of learning, and emotional development — not just academic success.\n\nI’m hoping to get insights on a few deeper aspects, especially from parents or anyone familiar with these schools: •\tWhich school provides more space and flexibility for kids to learn according to their individual interests? •\tWhich one has a stronger focus on values, community, and social development? •\tAny drawbacks or challenges you’ve experienced at either school?\n\nThanks so much for any advice or personal experiences you’re willing to share!

Hi all, we have a house on cannon beach, and the rock/break wall is considerably more washed away than our neighbors as the previous homeowners didn't keep up with it.

Good evening all!\n\nMy partner and I moved to Portland from Minneapolis about a month ago, and we are having a bizarre issue with our rental company (NMV Group — I’m not above naming and shaming). \n\nWhen we arrived, we were told that there were storage units on property. We didn’t expect this, as it wasn’t mentioned in our lease. However, our property manager told us (over email, so we have it in writing), that we had access to one, and that our normal key would open it up. Come to find out, not only does our key not work on any unit, but the storage unit we were told was ours is being used by another tenant.\n\nAfter figuring this out we emailed our manager back to figure out what unit we have access to. That was over a month ago, and we have received no response despite multiple emails and phone calls. We even drove to their office to try to talk to her in person, and we were not allowed in to speak to our manager. I have tried to look up contact info for anyone else in the building, but their website offers no additional info besides their main phone line, which we have already tried to call multiple times with no luck.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice for dealing with an unresponsive rental company? Most of the advice I’ve found has pertained to severe cases where units are nearly uninhabitable. I know that having access to a storage unit is not life or death, but it’s been extremely frustrating that I cannot get in contact with the person managing our property. \n\nThank you all in advance!\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9j9lv/property_manager_is_ignoring_me_looking_for_advice/	8	14	/r/askportland/comments/1k9j9lv/property_manager_is_ignoring_me_looking_for_advice/	2025-04-28 06:28:57.587732+00	2025-04-28 06:38:30.1705+00	2025-04-28 00:54:29+00	f	f	text	36	46	{not,property,lease,unit,storage,manager,company,told,no,advice}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Went to Sunset High School in Beaverton, and then PSU. MY (now ex) boyfriend helped me move from Beaverton to Charlotte Ave few years ago. His parents, who are the best people on the face of this earth, have keep my favorite arm chair for me all these years. The thing is, I have no idea how to get it here. After the passing of my childhood cat last year who came all the way here with me, I have been missing that chair especially recently. Shipping it is incredibly expensive. The thing I'm wondering is, and I know it's so unlikely, is there anyone in this sub that will be moving, trucking, or anything to any where near North Carolina anytime in the next year? I will obviously pay, I just cannot afford the quotes I'm getting of $700+. And yes, I know $700 is probably cheap, I just cannot afford it, so I'm posting in a last ditch effort. I don't have exact numbers but I could get it, I'd say the chair is 4 ft tall, 3x3 at the base, and is maybe 50lbs.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9g9gk/shipping_help_from_portland/	10	10	/r/askportland/comments/1k9g9gk/shipping_help_from_portland/	2025-04-28 06:28:49.197977+00	2025-04-28 06:38:30.1705+00	2025-04-27 22:24:28+00	f	f	text	30	50	{shipping,years,chair,will,just,ups,700,charlotte,beaverton,ago}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I am not asking you to trust me as an authority of 50501. In fact I am asking for you to turn your trust back towards your local organizations. 50501 in its original form was meant to be a call to action to the people by the people to support our constitutional governance. In the process of coordinating these protests, local communities within the states have formed strong relations that I have the utmost faith can coordinate the peoples future self advocacy. \n\nThe following are my suggestions to the community moving forward. \n\nAs a concept 50501 is not subject to ownership. The concept is that we all show up, at all 50 states, at each of the 50 state capitols in the solidarity of our support of our most basic human rights. \n\nNo one in this community has the authority to tell you what days you can or cannot protest as long as it is organized through the proper legal channels. \n\nNo one in this community has the right to tell you you don't have the authority to organize a protest as directed by the first amendment in the spirit of 50501. If you would like to form a community then do so. \n\nWe must participate in the democracy we wish to live in. This means our continued participation in elections, this means running for office on any level, this means civil discourse and exercising our first amendment rights. \n\n50501 does not win by outcompeting supportive movements. There are so many great communities already in place to find your voice and they need our support. \n\nWe must expect ourselves and our leaders to embody the ideals we wish for our society. This means remaining civil when we use our voice in our public spaces and when organizing we do so in a conscious and informed manner.

Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently trying to choose between two schools in the Portland area for my child: the German International School (GIS) and The International School (TIS), for chinese track. I’ve heard many good things about both and feel confident about the academic quality at each. \n\nI really care about finding a place where my child can continue to grow their curiosity, love of learning, and emotional development — not just academic success.\n\nI’m hoping to get insights on a few deeper aspects, especially from parents or anyone familiar with these schools:\n\t•\tWhich school provides more space and flexibility for kids to learn according to their individual interests?\n\t•\tWhich one has a stronger focus on values, community, and social development?\n\t•\tAny drawbacks or challenges you’ve experienced at either school?\n\nThanks so much for any advice or personal experiences you’re willing to share!

Hi again - \nYou guys have been so wonderful with answering all my *very many questions* so I have one more. \n\nNext school year I will have a hs sophmore and I'm mostly unfamiliar with PPS. We are currently in OK schools.

I have been looking at houses in the Roosevelt HS district and previous discussions have been kind of all over the place. \n\nSo parents and teachers, what are your *current* thoughts of Roosevelt?

Every day when I wait for the bus I look at this building and wonder why it's even here. Feels like a huge waste. I didn't used to care, but over time the curiosity's been eating me.\n\nI'm not from Portland, but I remember when they razed the old buildings and constructed "Pacific Plaza", friends and coworkers grieved what was there before- the beloved Steinhaus and Hung Far Low bars. "But it might not be so bad," they'd continue, "maybe something better will move in." 8 years on, and nothing has moved into its space. In fact, I dont think they've ever even removed the fence. \n\nI've never seen a shiny new property go unused in such a busy area like this. Is there something wrong with that place? Is there some secret property drama I'm not aware of? Or is its vacancy a symptom of the larger issue of unaffordable rent in portland? \n\nDid Portland really need to lose two beloved landmarks for this?	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1kb04l8/why_is_2463_se_82nd_former_hung_far_low_steinhaus/	20	10	/r/askportland/comments/1kb04l8/why_is_2463_se_82nd_former_hung_far_low_steinhaus/	2025-04-30 00:15:03.667077+00	2025-05-04 22:59:41.720155+00	2025-04-29 21:54:45+00	f	f	text	40	15	{even,not,place,down,82nd,empty,building,portland,something,go}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I used to go out to estacada and drive down 224 all the time a buddy of mine lives out there.\n\nLast 2 days me and the wife went out there to find a camping spot that's hopefully not at a camp ground. But as we were driving it's crazy how open it looks now. Trying to see if I could remember where one of our target shooting areas was.. Went down a side gravel road and it was all open and before it was all dense trees. Felt like I was going the wrong way lol. 	https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1kci3m4/sad_to_see_what_mt_hood_national_forest_looks/	64	30	/r/oregon/comments/1kci3m4/sad_to_see_what_mt_hood_national_forest_looks/	2025-05-02 01:38:19.789856+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 20:00:28+00	f	f	text	124	17	{forest,drive,looks,go,time,road,dense,trees,sad,national}	\N	\N	\N	\N

He’s an older man, white hair, a bit taller, thin build and he’s usually there with his German Shepherd. My girlfriend and I showed up at roughly 12:15, he showed up at about the same time and sat on the bench atop the grass hill by the water with his dog. We walked all the way to the Tualatin Community Park boat ramp and back, and when we came back to the parking lot, a group of obviously under age high school girls were there and one of them was distraught, visibly upset and berating the man for taking photos of them and acting inappropriate. \n\nWhat blows my mind is that there were at least 20 other ADULTS not doing a damn thing and just sitting there watching or couldn’t be bothered with the situation. \n\nProps to the young lady for standing up for her and her friends. my girl friend and I stayed for a minute to make sure everything was fine without having to escalate things. Calling non emergency authorities is pointless because technically no crime is committed but I did notify one of the park workers of the situation on our way out so at least they’re aware. \n\nIf you see something, speak up. Stand up for what’s right. And stay vigilant, there’s creeps everywhere in this world. \n	https://www.reddit.com/r/Tigard/comments/1kck205/creepy_older_guy_taking_photos_of_underage_girls/	32	14	/r/Tigard/comments/1kck205/creepy_older_guy_taking_photos_of_underage_girls/	2025-05-02 01:43:58.678053+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 21:23:27+00	f	f	text	60	22	{girls,taking,photos,park,older,guy,cook,high,school,time}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I pull up, pay the attendant for a wash, he hands me back my card with the warning that they can't guarantee my car will come out entirely clean due to the state it's going in. Fair, valid, totally understandable. HOWEVER, he says that I can circle back around for a second wash free of charge so that we can try to get as much off as possible.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is a Kaady Carwash policy for disgusting vehicles or if this guy was just feeling generous, but whatever it is I am extremely thankful. I took my car through, circled back to the front and the guy waved me through without even stopping. Peak customer service.

Hey all, I found some older posts about gift options, but as many of them are older I figured I’d throw it out there again. \n\nMy friend just moved out to Portland a few months ago — he’s the quiet creative and artsy type, but super funny and caring. He doesn’t do too many outdoor activities, so I’m thinking a gift card to a really great local shop that doesn’t have touristy souvenirs or something else that’s fun. I don’t think he’s made too many friends out there yet so I don’t want to gift him an experience that would be better shared with people but instead something he could do alone, invite someone to join if he wanted to etc. \n\nAny help is so appreciated! 	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1kck0iv/looking_for_a_gift/	7	19	/r/askportland/comments/1kck0iv/looking_for_a_gift/	2025-05-02 01:42:03.976812+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 21:21:37+00	f	f	text	45	27	{gift,card,great,movie,looking,older,friend,portland,artsy,doesn}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I reached out to Burley customer service, but they only have one copy of each year from the old business and aren't able to scan them.

Cheers PDX, love you forever.	I can't wait to see all the comments from backwoods Oregonians whose entire identity is built on false superiority.  If you're only listening to trash talkers, then Portland is some liberal hellscape where they hand out fentanyl at every public library at the tax payers' expense. \n\nBut if you actually spend time in the city, it's still a beautiful place to be.  Portland is green and alive and dynamic and irreverent.  Portland is anything but homogeneous, and never boring.  The people of Portland are actually free because they clearly and constantly don't care at all what anyone thinks of them.  That social pressure in small town life that forces you conform your behavior to everyone else's concept of 'normal'?  That nagging little brainworm can't find any oxygen in Portland.  We are actually free.\n\nIf you want to find things to hate about *anywhere* you can find them.  Ask any first responder and they'll tell you rural life has its own fair share of disgusting to go around.  But if you're looking for redeeming qualities and a sense of nature and quiet acceptance, you can find those things too and Portland has them in abundance. \n\nI'm proud of our city, I'm proud of our values, and I'm proud to have served a community so genuine in their commitment to diversity and inclusion.  Be good to each other, PDX.  I'm riding with you til the wheels fall off.	https://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2025/04/complain-all-you-want-but-a-new-report-calls-this-oregon-city-the-cleanest-metro-in-the-country.html	105	36	/r/oregon/comments/1kb1ujt/complain_all_you_want_but_a_new_report_names/	2025-04-30 00:11:24.168645+00	2025-05-04 22:59:41.720155+00	2025-04-29 23:11:23+00	f	f	link	177	5	{portland,find,city,beep,media,actually,don,things,proud,please}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Most of my current clothes are from when I was with my abusive ex-husband - nothing really "fits" or feels like me anymore. Everything I currently have is drab, gray/black and generally not form-fitting. My current husband jokes that I dress like Wednesday Adams (no hate towards her, but not my goal). I want to shift gears and find more vibrant pieces that would make me feel more feminine/youthful. I already tried to shop at Washington Square and big chain stores, but the styles there don't really speak to me (and I find myself gravitating towards the same baggy drab style that I am used to). I am currently pregnant (not showing yet, so stretchy clothing is a plus for the future), but I still want to feel cute!! I would really love to get some beautiful summery dresses or flowy tops.

This sudden decision alienated fans and sent a clear message that CONCACAF is failing to represent the full diversity of the nations it claims to serve. Human rights are not political, they are a fundamental part of our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Soccer should be for everyone.	https://vssg.ca/2025/04/concacafs-banner-ban-fails-the-spirit-of-the-game/	19	5	/r/Cascadia/comments/1kbuedc/concacafs_banner_ban_fails_the_spirit_of_the_game/	2025-05-01 05:29:41.514231+00	2025-05-04 23:06:46.523464+00	2025-04-30 23:19:31+00	f	f	link	29	52	{concacaf,banners,front,ban,spirit,sisters,supporters,group,rights,not}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I have a cool idea, here's what I'm thinking.\n\nI have a design studio here in Portland. I am in the beginning stage, which is difficult because, well, starting a business is simply a ton of work. The flip side of that is that there is a passion and excitement for the potential of what i can do, which is literally anything I want. So here it is, this is what I see for myself and my studio:\n\nThis will be the most fulfilling for me if my studio can revolve around a simple idea. Make cool sh\\*t for people who do cool sh\\*t. Why? because i like to surround myself with creative and like minded folks. Because i want to stray away from corporate branding as much is financially viable. Because it is fulfilling to do design for things that I also like. The analogy is this: "Top 40s music sounds good and a lot of people like it, but I'm more interested music that sounds new, different, unique, or weird. Drake will always make more money than "Pink Siifu", but drake could never make me feel the way "Pink Siifu" does". My studio should represent that same ethos, and I'm totally willing to trade monetary excess for work that can double as art. At my core, I am an artist and creative, and that's what i want my work to represent (as much as is possible in Capitalism).\n\n**So here's where you come in:**\n\nIn order for me to do the type of work that I want and get paid for it, I am gonna need to take a (very small) L and do some things pro bono aka for free or lowballed price. But that's great news for you, the creative person/people who don't have a huge budget to dedicate to branding, design, promotion etc.\n\nI would love to work with local rappers, musicians, artists or creatives of any kind. My art is in illustration, painting, graphic design, web design etc, but maybe you do ceramics, or ice sculptures, or knitting, or rug tufting i don't know, surprise me. You may need promotional posters, branding (logo, color palette, typography, custom fonts, brand direction), album art, event posters, printed media, merch design, sticker design. What the project will entail really depends on what you need and what can help you level up.\n\nSo if this is something that interests you, let me know. You can dm me at my studio insta: [https://www.instagram.com/pinkmatterdesignstudio/](https://www.instagram.com/pinkmatterdesignstudio/)\n\nYes, it has no posts yet. Maybe you'd like to be the first.\n\n\\-or-\n\nSimply respond here and link your work.	https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandmusic/comments/1kciem7/design_for_local_musicianscreativesor_unique/	4	1	/r/portlandmusic/comments/1kciem7/design_for_local_musicianscreativesor_unique/	2025-05-02 01:36:44.307558+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 20:13:13+00	f	f	text	6	54	{design,work,people,studio,creative,cool,want,will,branding,art}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I’m a student at a local college in a dental hygiene program, and I’m currently looking for patients to help me complete my clinical requirements.\n\nThe cleanings are totally free—no catch at all. The only thing it’ll cost is your time (typically about 2-3 appointments, each around 3 hours long). We also do things like oral cancer screenings, dental x-rays, assess gum health, and much more as part of the visit. You will even receive an exam from our dentist. \n\nRight now, I’m specifically looking for someone who’s had a dental cleaning sometime in the last couple of years. If that sounds like you and you're interested, feel free to shoot me an email! \n\nIf it’s been a long time since your last cleaning, no worries—you can still get seen, but it’ll need to be with a more advanced student and I can provide you with contact information. \n\nThanks so much in advance—your smile helps us graduate!	https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandPNW/comments/1k2ljxt/free_dental_cleanings/	1	0	/r/PortlandPNW/comments/1k2ljxt/free_dental_cleanings/	2025-04-28 06:22:58.010797+00	2025-05-05 04:29:10.788629+00	2025-04-19 01:58:56+00	f	f	text	1	100	{dental,free,cleanings,student,looking,no,ll,time,long,cleaning}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I'm here to give you the nitty gritty of what's going down.\n\nShort summary, we got a new owner in January. This new owner misrepresented himself and his intentions to the previous owner and all of us working here, and in the past months has mismanaged the business and his employees. The real tipping point is the fact that our paychecks have been delayed for two pay cycles. (As of writing this, some employees still have not been paid.) This is the primary reason why we have walked out, but it is far from the only reason.\n\nWe have a meeting with the owner scheduled to discuss our options moving forward and will have more to share at that time, but for now I want to make it clear that everyone working here is passionate and dedicated to this business and we are committed to continuing our presence in the community, whatever that may look like.

Here is our County Commissioners advertising a prayer event that just so happens to proceed a Trump protest in the same space scheduled later in the afternoon. In the past year they have kicked 4H and the OSU Extension office out of the county. They are threatening to kill the County library. They have moved their meetings behind closed doors. One of them was recalled for being a prick and his crony is now cock of the rock. They created a sweetheart deal for an ally to be the county administrator for a whopping $350,000 a year while laying off county employees under their own version of DODGE.

Especially as human rights are getting stripped back and fascism in our government is escalating, we need to support our most vulnerable and refuse to fraternize with the police.

I'm a remote worker and like to work in cafes when I can. The environment suits me and I like supporting local businesses. The problem I'm facing is that every cafe in the city, as far as I can tell, is absolutely freezing. I know I run cold, so I dress warmly, complete with jacket, hat, and fingerless gloves, and still end up shivering more often than not.\n\nCan anyone recommend a cafe that's open at least until 5 p.m., offers decent coffee, and maintains a temperature above the 60s? (Higher would be nice. Low 80s is my unattainable pipe dream.) \n\nI'm looking for somewhere that doesn't open its sliding garage-door walls at every opportunity, that doesn't insist on keeping fans blowing year-round, and that doesn't crank the A/C as low as it'll go the moment the sun peeks out from behind a cloud. Somewhere oppressively hot. Somewhere that demands tank tops and shorts from anyone with a normal body temperature.\n\nI just want to consume a stupid number of overpriced lattes without my fingers getting too stiff to type.\n\nNorth PDX would be nice, but honestly, I'm willing to drive for this.\n\nEDIT: In the true spirit of "Ask and ye shall receive," moments after I posted this I left the freezing Roseline on Alberta to try the Case Study down the street, and OH MY GOD THERE'S A LOFT HERE, and heat rises.

My husband and I will be here for one night in June and I’d like input on which hotel.

My husband makes a mean breakfast burrito and uses the extra large tortillas. However, every extra large store bought tortilla brand I have tried tastes and feels like cardboard. We usually use the mission tortillas for everything else (unless I’m making homemade) but I cannot find an extra large tortilla brand that is as soft as mission and doesn’t taste terrible. Is there a Mexican store, market or restaurant in town that sells extra large tortillas that taste good? We have tried ones from winco, Fred Meyers, US chef store, Trader Joe’s (theirs are also too small for us) and haven’t found one that tastes good.	https://www.reddit.com/r/beaverton/comments/1kebs8g/where_can_i_buy_good_extra_large_tortillas/	24	31	/r/beaverton/comments/1kebs8g/where_can_i_buy_good_extra_large_tortillas/	2025-05-05 04:20:19.19537+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 04:47:05+00	f	f	text	86	25	{extra,large,tortillas,brand,good,store,tried,taste,ones,winco}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I've been trying to spruce up this sub for locals, so everyone isn't drowned out by the constant "help me plan my vacation" and "here's photos of my vacation" posts. As an experiment, I'm starting a weekly pinned "community news" scheduled post that will appear on Monday mornings at 7am. \n\nThe idea behind the post is that we can share things like ongoing or new road construction, concerts and events, yard sales, or whatever else you feel like the community should know is happening (or isn't happening) throughout the week.\n\nWe can have more than one pinned weekly scheduled post, so if you can think of any other topics that might be covered. I'm also open to other suggestions about mod features, so if there's something you'd like to see, please drop it in the comments.	https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonCoast/comments/1kdznen/weekly_roregoncoast_scheduled_posts/	30	4	/r/OregonCoast/comments/1kdznen/weekly_roregoncoast_scheduled_posts/	2025-05-03 23:45:40.932513+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 18:27:05+00	f	f	text	38	47	{posts,community,post,will,weekly,scheduled,something,isn,vacation,pinned}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Hey everyone, hope this is okay to post here as it seems this post was being censored in r/vancouverwa.\n\nMe and my boyfriend (gay couple) recently moved to the area as he initially got a job in Vancouver but then last minute got an offer in Portland. We already signed a lease so we are in Vancouver for the next year.\n\nOverall, the area has been really nice and friendly but I'm worried a bit too homophobic so I'm just wondering what your opinions are and what areas to avoid that aren't LGBTQ friendly.\n\nAnyway, yesterday we did a short walk to a burger joint then were holding hands in public on the sidewalk and walked back to a Target where we parked. The walk there, no one cared but on the way back, these GenZ teenage girls (we are millennials if that matters) in a black SUV rolled down their windows like three or four times to yell: "F*cking Gays, you guys are f*ggots!" just to make sure we heard I guess lol. I know GenZ youth nowadays are being taught to hate LGBTQ so I don't pay too much attention to it.\n\nAnyway, this isn't something we have really experienced before, should we not display any PDA (Public Displays of Affection) in public here? We literally were only holding hands, nothing else lol.\n\nI told the boyfriend we probably have to tone it down here since the area may be too conservative for us. Personally, would like to hear from other LGBTQ that is in the area and what their experiences are and what areas to avoid.\n\nThanks!	https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kesx34/how_antilgbtq_is_vancouver/	0	47	/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kesx34/how_antilgbtq_is_vancouver/	2025-05-05 04:16:37.242927+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 20:01:11+00	f	f	text	94	23	{vancouver,portland,lgbtq,area,just,public,don,conservative,ll,find}	\N	\N	\N	\N

She is an indoor only cat and ran out while I wasn't looking, there was some commotion that scared her and the door was open. I am usually very careful about ensuring she is safe in my bedroom to avoid this happening while the front door is open,  but I was slipping. I know it's no excuse. But now- I really need y'alls help 😕 \n\n\nOliver/Ollie is a 4 year old, female, seal-point Siamese. She weighs 10 lbs and has a medium length coat. Ollie is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations, but very unfortunately, not microchipped. She is/was my registered ESA, but I think the license has expired. \n\n\nOllie has always been very fearful and anxious of loud noises and strangers. That being said, it took me almost our entire first year together to gain her trust completely, which was a lot of work and even more patience. Since then, when we are together, her confidence shines through, and she has illuminated my life in a way that is so much more than I could have ever imagined or asked for. I love her so much that my heart literally hurts as I write this. I am literally just as much her emotional support human as she is my emotional support cat- she cries and wails any time we are apart. I've had pets throughout my life, but I've never felt such a unique connection, strong bond, or such a genuine love from any pet before, until my baby Ollie. We are both 100% good as long as we're together.\n\n\nOn three separate occasions now, while I was walking around trying to find her and calling her name the way she likes, I heard her meowing frantically back at me. I KNOW 100% without a shadow of a doubt that it was her,  because I've  heard it before, and well... because she's my cat. When I heard her, I was standing between two houses on NW Everett between NW 21st Ave and NW 22nd Pl. If you are traveling up in numbers, or west, up NW Everett *toward* NW 22nd and *away* from NW 21st, the houses are on your right. The second and third RESIDENTIAL homes, to be exact. I emphasize "residential" because on the corner of NW Everett &amp; NW 21st there is a big white building that was a restaurant for a long time, so when I say the 2nd and 3rd *houses*,  this building is excluded.\n\n\nWhy haven't I been able to find her yet, if I keep hearing her, you are definitely wondering?\n\n\nWell, EVERY TIME I've gone to that specific place to try and locate and retrieve her (i cannot for the life of me figure out if her meow is coming from ground level or from inside one of the houses cuz echoes super badly), this old man comes outside and starts asking me all sorts of irrelevant, judgmental and rude questions, pretends to care about my cat for legitimately .02 seconds, then proceeds to pick a fight with me by saying more dickish things until I leave because I'm getting too mad. Now I've gone at different times of day, and gotten the same response each time.....? The weird part of the whole thing is,  he lives in the left house if you're facing the two I was standing between. I tell him, "I'm not doing anything wrong or anything that should affect you. Im just looking for my cat, I know shes around here somewhere, I heard her" and I tell him he's making it so my cat doesn't meow back anymore (she won't be responsive if she hears any sort of unfamiliar/male voice whatsoever). Like, im not joking when i say i was doing NOTHING besides calling for my cat, i wasn't looking through windows or doing anything invasive or illegal. But the old douche says he "didn't hear *ONE* thing", and that he's "able to hear *EVERYTHING* from inside the house, but didn't hear *any* cat meows". "Didn't hear one peep!" Wtf? He's just way too adamant about how he "didn't hear anything" for it to be believable. The last time i saw the old prick, I told him he's weird asf and acting suspicious and probably has my cat locked up in his basement. \n\n\nHow can I get my cat back? What do I do? I've made flyers and put a bunch on the front doors of the two houses, as well as the neighboring ones. I've paid $45 for a Pawboost listing, posted on Craigslist, etc.\nWhat are the laws for searching the exterior of someone's property for a lost pet, as long as there are no fences between the front and back yards? which there arent- any Joe Schmoe can just waltz directly to the backyard from the front sidewalk if they wanted to, but I'm really not trying to get a trespassing charge; ONLY because it could potentially postpone me getting my baby back even longer.  \n\n\nI'm planning on going back this evening and trying again, and if he has that much of a problem with me looking for my cat, I'm just going to have to call the police because I seriously feel like i have no other option. I've tried ignoring him, but he won't leave me to do what I need to do. Is old man acting odd, or am i just overanalyzing the situation ?  I am so desperate to get my baby girl back. She's all I think about. I'm so worried I can't even tell you. I really need a directional microphone. Or something. Ugh! I'm so kicking myself for not getting her microchipped. And for letting her run out in the first place. 😢 \n\n	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kex3sx	68	11	/r/Portland/comments/1kex3sx/long_post_warning_loststolen_cat_please_help/	2025-05-05 04:19:44.29101+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 23:08:20+00	f	f	text	90	24	{cat,ve,just,back,nw,ollie,really,old,hear,help}	\N	\N	\N	\N

They decided I was ineligible because I hadn't registered for some work seeking program, despite paying several weeks of benefits prior to the decision. I had been applying for jobs in my field and hadn't turned down any offers, and logged everything as required. I appealed the decision but I didn't know to keep claiming weekly benefits while waiting for the hearing. I didn't claim a couple weeks before finding that out and now I can't claim any more - the option isn't there on my Frances portal. Am I missing something or is our UI system just broken?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who commented with helpful advice. I know what I need to do now.

He was my best friend.\n\nI adopted him from Oregon Humane Society a year and 8 months ago (who at the time was named cash), when he was around 12 years old. Ever since that day, he changed my life in ways I didn’t think possible. \n\nI loved him so much, it breaks me that I’m finally writing this. I wish the time we had together wasn’t so short, but every moment was filled with an unimaginable amount of love and joy. \n\nToad went everywhere throughout Portland with my partner and I. However, Lone Fir Cemetery was our particularly special spot. He touched so many random strangers on our various adventures. \n\nI’ve uploaded pictures of random special moments of him. The last picture is the very first picture I took of him, the day we adopted him. \n\nIf you ever happened to meet Toad, or even just saw him, I would love to know in the comments.\n\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdxaiw	549	21	/r/Portland/comments/1kdxaiw/toads_portland_adventures/	2025-05-03 23:57:51.274209+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 16:44:54+00	f	f	text	591	3	{toad,adventures,year,picture,amp,portland,passed,touched,best,friend}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I managed to stop in time, but the car next to me — driven by an older woman — almost hit him. He seemed to jump out of the way and wasn’t injured.\n\nI pulled over at the nearby Safeway and went back to check if everyone was okay or if they needed my dash cam footage. When I got there, the cyclist was demanding money from the driver — first $300, then $200, then $100 — insisting she hit him. She was clearly shaken up and panicking. Another guy (his friend) showed up and started backing him up, making it two guys trying to pressure this woman into paying.\n\nI told her I had dash cam footage and was happy to send it to her. Then I called 911. The moment I mentioned police, they bolted.\n\nI stayed with the driver and texted her the footage in case she needs to file a report or protect herself.\n\nJust posting this in case anyone else sees similar behavior. The biker was riding aggressively and clearly knew how to stir up confusion to pressure someone into handing over money. If you witness something like this, don’t ignore it. Your dash cam or presence could make a huge difference.\n\nStay safe out there, Portland.\n\n	https://v.redd.it/ijx532gg3iye1	379	60	/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kdlb5n/heads_up_scammy_hitandrun_setup_near_se_122nd/	2025-05-03 23:54:41.0206+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 05:13:36+00	f	f	hosted:video	499	6	{just,hit,122nd,powell,car,woman,dash,cam,footage,money}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Due to my disability, I get dizzy and fatigued very quickly—just standing for too long makes me feel like I’m going to pass out. It’s made keeping up with housework extremely difficult.\n\nI’m looking for any free resources or services that might be available for someone in my position. I can’t afford to pay for a cleaning service right now, and I’m not able to work extra hours to save up. If anyone knows of an organization that helps veterans or disabled individuals with things like this—or if you’re someone local who would be willing to volunteer a bit of your time to help me clean—I would be incredibly grateful.\n\nThank you for reading, and I appreciate any help, advice, or leads you can give.\n\nTo clarify: I am indeed a veteran. I developed POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) while I was in the military and was medically discharged in 2022. Yes, I may have a boyfriend who is currently serving, but that doesn’t change the fact that I served and sacrificed too. I’m also allowed to pursue higher education now that I’m out, and doing so doesn’t make me any less of a veteran or less in need of support.	https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kdy837/disabled_veteran_in_need_of_help_with_apartment/	21	42	/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kdy837/disabled_veteran_in_need_of_help_with_apartment/	2025-05-03 23:55:07.511861+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 17:25:38+00	f	f	text	105	21	{help,veteran,disabled,need,cleaning,disability,services,veterans,clean,amp}	\N	\N	\N	\N

And to be clear I'm not saying those are the "best" just where I've gone in the past. \n\nBonus points if it's on the west side/the Tigard/Beaverton/Hillsboro areas but I'm 100% willing to drive to the east side for some good examples of complicated to make at home dishes. 	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1kdy9ln/favorite_casual_spots_with_specialties_you_cant/	29	32	/r/askportland/comments/1kdy9ln/favorite_casual_spots_with_specialties_you_cant/	2025-05-03 23:56:11.929027+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 17:27:27+00	f	f	text	93	24	{chicken,not,just,fried,best,beaverton,making,bothered,sometimes,home}	\N	\N	\N	\N

We were lucky enough to get a bunch of great pictures from yesterday with professional-grade photography equipment. In many cases, this means that people's faces are identifiable even in wide angle group shots. As a group, we're conflicted between the desire to highlight all the awesome attendees at our events and people's desires for and expectations of privacy. Especially in the age of digital surveillance, we don't want to expose anyone to additional risk they did not sign up for. This doesn't seem like an appropriate decision for the organizers to make for everyone, so I'm here to ask what you all think. What expectations of privacy do you have at protest or activism events? Under what conditions would you be ok with a photo of your face being posted online, for example to 50501 Portland social media accounts? We welcome your input, and I'd like to express again our gratitude to everyone (attendees especially) who made yesterday a success.	https://www.reddit.com/r/50501Portland/comments/1kdfx5k/community_input_request_posting_photos_from/	26	26	/r/50501Portland/comments/1kdfx5k/community_input_request_posting_photos_from/	2025-05-03 23:50:52.515222+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 00:12:43+00	f	f	text	78	26	{photos,people,think,protest,everyone,group,privacy,face,50501,input}	\N	\N	\N	\N

Spayed. Good with dogs and cats (after some adjustment period, she gets a little too excited to play with them). The reason they can no longer keep her is because they own a few horses and this girl likes to nip at their faces which could potentially cause harm to her and the horses. \n\nShe’s a sweet cuddle bug and needs a family thats willing to give her the love and attention that she deserves!

I asked the mods if I could highlight my own business for Local First Thursdays and they said it was cool, so here I am.\n\nI'm a professional outdoorsman and mushroom farmer located in Salem. I teach year-round foraging lessons. In fall, that focus is on chanterelles, porcini, matsutake, hedgehogs, cauliflower and chicken of the woods. I primarily cover the Willamette Valley, Coast Range and Cascade foothills.\n\nMy spring modules focus on yellow and black morels. In summer, I teach berry foraging, as they play an integral role in our mushroom ecosystems. I also do private consults to help people understand their land and the abundant gifts nature provides.\n\nI sell a variety of fresh and dried mushrooms as well as the cultures used to grow them. I specialize in native species but also stock some commercial varieties.\n\nI have an [Etsy ](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ORGourmetMushrooms) and my own [website](http://www.orgourmetmushrooms.com).\n\nIn the spirit of supporting local small business, I encourage you to visit Adan's Automotive in Salem on Silverton Road. I've had a lot of car troubles and their expert work and affordability has helped keep me in business. They're a great shop for the working person and have fast turnaround times.	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcbjwx	21	3	/r/oregon/comments/1kcbjwx/oregon_gourmet_mushrooms/	2025-05-02 01:38:53.069143+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 15:28:54+00	f	f	text	27	38	{foraging,mushrooms,business,mushroom,great,local,salem,teach,lessons,fall}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I was hiking Tidbits Mountain in the Willamette national forest yesterday when I heard a very low frequency pulse that kept starting and stopping about every 20 seconds.

Why? We can do better. \n\n(From their socials)\n\nTabor Dance originated as an ecstatic dance event.\n\nWhat is ecstatic dance? Whatever degree of rhythm you've got, that's the right degree of rhythm to have!\n\nDuring the pandemic, the dancers were unable to meet indoors as they regularly would. They tried dancing with each other over Zoom, but the vibe just wasn't the same.\n\nConsidering the limitations of the pandemic, the founders of Tabor Dance found a way to comply with social distancing while still meeting in public to dance. To do so, they met at Mount Tabor, found a paved area around Reservoir 5, and instructed dance attendees to draw a 6-ft radius around them with chalk.\n\nWhat resulted were dozens of people cageless cage dancing with one another!\n\nAs regulations eased and Covid died down, Tabor Dance exponentially spread. Nowadays, during nice weather, what began as dozens of people is now in the thousands of people. What's stayed the same is that it's a free, weekly event with a strong emphasis on social interaction.\n\nA great story of how an alternative community not only perseveres, but thrives in Portland!	https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1keo2ki/portland_weird_united_on_tabor_dance/	14	18	/r/PortlandOR/comments/1keo2ki/portland_weird_united_on_tabor_dance/	2025-05-05 04:16:11.770845+00	2025-05-05 07:11:31.32718+00	2025-05-04 16:36:00+00	f	f	text	50	34	{dance,tabor,people,portland,ecstatic,event,degree,rhythm,right,pandemic}	\N	\N	\N	\N

My partner and I are having a baby this fall, and we need to find a house or duplex with preferably two bedrooms and some outdoor space. I have tried browsing Facebook marketplace, Craigslist, and Zillow, but the rental market for houses seems very very competitive right now. There seems to be many people applying for the same houses all at once. I’m nervous that we may not find what we need.

I've been trying to get a reference photo of a busy coffee shop for a while now. I've been to a few different shops that I just picked because they were nearby, and all of them were basically empty, even though Google Maps said it was the busiest time of the week when I was there. I don't care how good the coffee is. I don't even drink coffee. I just need a lot of people to be in the shop, and preferably also a few in line waiting to order.

She's constantly falling and her house is too messed up for caregivers to help her because they have lived there for many decades and since her heart attack a decade ago their ability to keep it clean has degraded plus the place is very old. With a caregiver the rental will stay clean \n\n\nShe's losing the care facility soon and 8k a month for assisted living is ridiculous. If her husband moves in it would cost them another 8k also.\n\n\nMy idea is if anyone has a place for rent, maybe we could work out a quick short term with option for long term deal. We can do a few months up front,  and an expedited fee . We just need a quiet place to move them into for a few months maybe longer, all depends on how good we can get them to enjoy the place.\n\n\nNo steps, 2 bedroom(maybe could get a live in\ncaregiver), hopefully not loud area( cause they are grumpy old people), eastside towards gresham,and good size bathroom would be best.  These are just hopes but in no way requirements \n\n\nPlease please please if you have anything that could work within a couple weeks let me know.l still have to convince them or convince the hospital case worker that this is an available option before I can get you a check but honestly I believe this is the only option that will give them a better live cause they will leave assisted living facility within a month then go back to falling over things in their home	https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kb1ae2/looking_for_quick_residence_for_my_aunt/	1	3	/r/PortlandOR/comments/1kb1ae2/looking_for_quick_residence_for_my_aunt/	2025-04-30 00:14:12.398563+00	2025-05-04 22:59:41.720155+00	2025-04-29 22:45:31+00	f	f	text	7	25	{place,rent,may,live,old,rental,will,facility,month,living}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I'm looking to play a show in Portland on or around Friday, 7/11 (coming up kind of soon, I know). I lived in PDX 2008-2012 and currently live in Philadelphia, and this will be my first show in Portland since moving back to the east coast! I play intimate, dynamic piano/synth-based pop with soulful, haunting vocal vibes and a classical and atmospheric undercurrent (some influences and/or comparisons: Elliott Smith, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos, Neil Young, Grizzly Bear). Played at a bunch of spots in Portland when I lived there, including Miss Studios and Portland Queer Music Festival, as well as tours of west and east coasts. Back in town to reconnect with old friends n fans and to hype up my first full-length album now in progress after many years of neglecting/running from my creativity!\n\n  \nAnyway, if anyone out there wants to set up a show or needs an opener/additional act for one you have on the books, I'd love to discuss. Also open to suggestions on venues/contacts to try, including open mics with a featured artist situation.\n\n  \nYou can check out some samples (albeit from way back when I recorded my EP in my Portland days) below. Happy to share samples of the album in progress if anyone interested, but don't want to post it publicly.\n\n  \n[https://zachzaitlin.bandcamp.com/](https://zachzaitlin.bandcamp.com/)\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\nZZ	https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandmusic/comments/1ke700l/phillyformer_pdx_artist_looking_for_july_show/	1	0	/r/portlandmusic/comments/1ke700l/phillyformer_pdx_artist_looking_for_july_show/	2025-05-04 01:26:39.337073+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.13724+00	2025-05-04 00:11:55+00	f	f	self	1	18	{portland,show,back,pdx,artist,looking,play,lived,first,east}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I'm trying to help my Dad (64yo) look for part time (10 - 20 hours/week) work because he struggles with technology. Everything I can find requires the ability to stand all day and be able to lift up to 50lbs. He can't do that. He has had two hip replacements and falls when he has to stand for too long.\n\nHe can barely cover just his housing costs (at an affordable senior rental) off of Social Security alone and his 401k only really has enough to cover one medical emergency, so he can't take a monthly payment from that. He's great at talking to people, and is quite extroverted. He loves history, mythology, science fiction, and board games. I feel like a Board Game Store Greeter or a Renaissance Faire Help Desk would be his ideal positions, but in lieu of that, where should I look?	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1kcbib5/what_jobs_can_seniors_do_here_who_have_worked/	91	43	/r/askportland/comments/1kcbib5/what_jobs_can_seniors_do_here_who_have_worked/	2025-05-02 01:41:04.694936+00	2025-05-04 23:06:45.954984+00	2025-05-01 15:27:08+00	f	f	text	177	10	{work,help,people,80,whole,look,stand,able,hip,cover}	\N	\N	\N	\N

As an online dater in Portland, I find that every other profile just mentions how much they love the outdoors. I think nature is pretty and I will go for a hike if someone wants to ,but I’d also just rather bike around town, climb at a gym consume some music/film or play a board game. I don’t want to move to get more dates, but I feel like a leper here. Am I reading the situation correctly?

It feels like a coffee roaster first - a lot of funky roasts that aren’t flavored coffee but still have a lot of interesting notes going on - while still have a host of really cool, unique drinks of their own. (Seriously, I get a couple bags of beans, a cold coffee on tap, a barrel-aged mocha, and a pastry every time I go.)\n\nI know there’s a million good coffee places in Portland, but I’ve only got three days, and I really want one with this^ vibe. Any recommendations?\n\n(Btw - already tried the vanilla bean latte at Above GRND and loved it. Sweet, but not like candy, and still a strong flavor to the espresso as well.)	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1kdushh/best_coffee_shops_in_portland/	10	37	/r/askportland/comments/1kdushh/best_coffee_shops_in_portland/	2025-05-03 23:56:38.122999+00	2025-05-05 06:51:41.721419+00	2025-05-03 14:53:15+00	f	f	text	84	25	{coffee,drinks,interesting,really,beans,good,best,shop,latte,favorite}	\N	\N	\N	\N
