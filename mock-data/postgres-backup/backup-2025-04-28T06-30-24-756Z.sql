They include identifying what’s at risk and how it’s at risk.\n\nSo far, so good. But the next step is prioritizing the threats and allocating mitigation resources based on those priorities. The problem I have with this bill is I have not seen any but the most anecdotal evidence suggesting there is any sort of significant risk from vote-by-mail.

The bill's requirement for government-issued photo identification disenfranchise eligible voters who lack such documentation, effectively suppressing their right to vote. Oregon's vote-by-mail system has a proven track record of enhancing voter turnout and ensuring electoral integrity; dismantling it in favor of in-person voting lacks justification and undermines decades of successful practice. The proposed changes could lead to increased administrative costs and logistical challenges, straining county resources and potentially causing confusion among voters. Maintaining the current vote-by-mail system preserves accessibility, convenience, and the democratic principle of inclusive participation for all eligible Oregonians.	3	\N	2025-04-01 06:13:44.223051+00	2025-04-01 06:30:21.662876+00	2025-03-31 22:06:47+00	f	mkre9bz

If you are willing to leave on good terms and establish a payment plan for unpaid rent, they may be willing to work with you. An eviction isn’t desirable for either of you. And as sad as it is, you need to rehome those cats. You cannot afford to give them the life they deserve. And frankly when this is your living scenario you should not be putting money towards anything except housing stability.	157	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.006409+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.006409+00	2025-03-31 14:00:07+00	f	mkoptjk

There they will give you a few options. 1) there will be representatives there from rent assistance programs that are income based and you can apply which will postpone the eviction until you receive an approval or not from those programs. 2) they will give you the option to voluntarily vacate the property (this will not be an eviction on your record but past rent will still be owed to the landlord and you can set up payments with them) or 3) your landlord may allow you to make payments to stay within the property. But make sure you attend the first trial because if you don’t they will rule in favor of the property owner and you will be removed that day.	15	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.012251+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.012251+00	2025-03-31 22:23:52+00	f	mkrha4o

I know someone else they are paying rent for because them becoming homeless will make their mental/health much worse. I'd look into that especially based on what you said here. You would start by calling your health home/ care coordinator. \n\nYou can file for unemployment because you've been available to work but nfoodiven many shifts.

Take all the legal help you can get, take a deep breath, and start looking for jobs because the one you're at is obviously not cutting it. \n\nIt's going to be ok. You need more support than you have right now, but you *will* get through this. I was really depressed and unemployed for a while- I was essentially spending all day doing .. frankly, pretty demeaning art to make ends meet. \n\nIt felt impossible to get out of that hole. I was living with family, super obese, I spent all day mentally berating myself, and I just kept spiralling further into food addiction and self hate. But, one day, I reached out for help at Old Town Clinic. I got treatment for my mental health, and I started actually being able to function and make healthier choices. I was still isolated, but I started making online friends. I started feeling better physically, and I found I had energy to get to the job hunt. I landed a job, then I found a DnD group, got my own place, and I'm building up a social network, slowly but surely. I got promoted at work. Life isn't perfect, but an upward spiral started and I'm holding on for dear life. This all happened to me over the course of about 8 months. I hope it helps to read this, at least a little.	20	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.018373+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.018373+00	2025-03-31 16:15:27+00	f	mkpgej9

I think the most important thing for you is to maintain perspective so you can tackle the challenges you need to face. These are very solvable, trust.\n\nYou are way too young &amp; this is way too small a problem to even consider yourself a failure, let alone ponder self-harm. It can be difficult to see that clearly when you're in the thick of it but I promise you can come back from this quite easily.\n\nHere's some context to understand my point:\n\n* the average American carries over $50k debt personally\n* the average household carries over $105k debt\n\nSo, compared to the average American you're financially in better shape. You have an urgent need to address, sure, but overall things aren't as bleak as they may seem.\n\nYour rent is quite low for Portland so trying to work something out to stay put is probably your best option. Since you have $2k you can offer to pay April and May upfront, plus a longer term plan to repay your unpaid rent over time. Before you send any cash though, make sure you get whatever plan you agree to in writing signed by both you and your landlord. If you need help wording this in a letter just ask.\n\nTo make good on that commitment, and generally to make it as an adult, you need to find a reliable source of income so start looking for another job to add to your current one or replace it. The minimum wage in Portland is around $16 per hour and the city is quite commutable without a car, so you can cover your living expenses with literally any full time job.\n\nGood luck &amp; keep your head up!	2	\N	2025-04-01 06:30:44.025331+00	2025-04-01 06:30:44.025331+00	2025-03-31 23:50:21+00	f	mkrwcxb

I know you are drowning right now and everything probably feels impossible, but things will get better. Hang in there!\n\nI'm hoping some of the resources people posted can help you. But just a word of caution: be careful. There are slimy people out there who will take adantage of you because they know you need to escape a bad situation.\n\nAlso - can you find a grief support group? Maybe one that meets on Zoom calls? Being around people who understand what you are going through and support you will make you feel understood/heard and that is *so* important. If you search for "grief support group Oregon" you can find many options.\n\nFinal note: if you need pragmatic help doing small things like editing your resume, I could help with that (ChatGPT is honestly pretty good too). Are you looking for jobs in Portland? Or are you in a space where that's not even on your radar right now? When I've felt hopelessly behind/overwhelmed by life, often the best thing I can do is pick one small thing and accomplish it. Check out Tiny Habits by Dr. Fogg. He has a free program where he will get on phone calls with you and sometimes just hearing a friendly / supportive voice can be good (same goes for grief support group!).	13	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.800747+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.800747+00	2025-04-10 16:53:19+00	f	mmezv9h

This is devastating. I created a loose “grief gang” group for people who are experiencing loss, the discord link is: https://discord.gg/Z8NC66Nh\n\nThe group is Portland/Vancouver based, and I know there are people in transitional housing situations that may have a place for you or resources that can help. I don’t have housing suggestions, but myself (and others in the grief gang I’m sure) could help you move. At the very least, it’s a safe space to vent about all of this and meet some friends locally who feel safe. \n\nPeople in Portland are so friendly and understanding.

Especially live in care giver or those work programs. I also suggest calling Homeforward and talking to them about your options. They're a low income/housing kinda help program most of portland area/s section 8/hud housing programs use.\n\n  \nIf you need help with resume reach out to me, I'll gladly help build you one to use to apply for jobs. If you just want a friend in the area to talk to and we can go on walks just to get out please reach out. Grief is hard on your own in a new area and not having friends can be rough.	3	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.814733+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.814733+00	2025-04-10 17:01:42+00	f	mmf1l9g

First, I am so sorry for what you're going through, I can't imagine losing my partner and being in this world, at this time, especially queer, alone. \nMy partner and I are new to Portland. As much as I wish I had stable housing to potentially offer you, or even great resources, I don't. \nI can offer you a shoulder to lean on. You're welcome to message me any time for any reason. I am in my early 30s, female, and queer.  I am "Cali sober."(I use cannabis, but currently, my financial situation doesn't allow for that). \nI hope that you find somewhere safe, or at least some good resources.  I'm sure some people on this thread will have those for you.\nHang in there.\nYou're NOT alone. Things will get better if you work at it.	12	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.818849+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.818849+00	2025-04-10 14:30:51+00	f	mme6zyx

I dread facing the same, or leaving my partner to do so, so I feel for you. I don't have the resources to share with you, as far as places I know are safe, but Portland should have resources (off the top of my head Street Roots is the only example I can offer).\n\nKeep your head up, because you can absolutely make it through this, even if it's the hardest thing you've ever faced.

Grief is such a difficult thing, and to be dealing with it on top of an inadequate support network is that much worse. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and ongoing difficulties. \n\nThings can get better, and I'm sure you know this, time helps but only as much as you let it. \n\nI'm glad you are reaching out.  Do you hope to land in Portland or are you wanting somewhere more rural? What kind of work are you hoping to move into? Do you have a car?\n\n Do you have any hobbies or sports you play? Perhaps getting involved in one of those communities locally can help you get out of your dad's house more.\n\nThere are some online education resources that could help you get a certificate to be better qualified for certain jobs, that could be something to focus on while finding safe housing. I think most can be done with a phone. If you're interested in that DM me and I'll help you out. I would love to offer you a place to stay but I'm in transition right now myself and am not able to currently. \n\n\nMostly I just want to feed you and hug you. But I can't so I've tried to offer some tips. I really feel for you and hope you get what you need.	2	\N	2025-04-11 03:33:18.828609+00	2025-04-11 03:33:18.828609+00	2025-04-10 17:51:53+00	f	mmfc2mi

Everything is in bloom with greenery overflowing everywhere and most of us are a still a little stunned and starstruck at the reappearance of the sun and reasonably cheerful weather.  \n\nThat said, having lived in other big cities and in different countries, I've never been on the Portland as a post-apocalyptic hell-hole bandwagon in the first place, so maybe I'm a little biased.	15	\N	2025-04-28 00:16:42.450128+00	2025-04-28 05:54:45.326796+00	2025-04-28 00:00:36+00	f	mpegdpv

There are people living here who were convinced the entirety of Portland was burning because of "riots and lawlessness on the streets" because Fox news was running with that 24/7 for a while. I had patients who wouldn't be convinced otherwise, and I'm like "I live in Portland...do I look like I'm on fire right now?"\n\nSo now we're back to Portland being vilified on the news and the cycle continues.\n\nPortland really is a nice city with lots to do, and the surrounding areas are amazing for outdoorsy people.\n\nPeople hating on Portland is like people hating on the Midwest, you know? Calling all the Midwest "flyover Monsanto states with nothing but corn and cow shit".

I had a 36 mile commute once in my life and I'd never do it again. One accident, a little ice, someone getting pulled over, etc and your commute time multiplies. I'd much rather commute for fun than work. If the weather is bad, you're probably not going out anyways. If you do it, maybe pick a town in-between but then you're not close to anything. There is differing cost of living as well. A quick search says the COL is 17% higher in Portland. Your gas and car wear &amp; tear is higher. You shouldn't consider your time free (4 extra hours per week in your car). Your pay will remain the same since you're keeping your job.

I lived by the airport and I drive to South Salem to take care of my grandma with dementia. I take her grocery shopping. Sometimes it takes me three hours to get to Salem and get home at night. It’s better to drive like late. Late at night don’t even try to drive between 6 AM and 10 AM. Or anytime between 2 PM and 6 PM because you will definitely be in the car for four hours. My sciatic nerve started messing up from sitting for so long. You think it’s not that big of a deal but because of traffic it’s a huge deal.	1	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.205663+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.205663+00	2025-04-27 02:42:57+00	f	mp9377z

There’s usually no traffic, occasionally you hit it on the way back into pdx around the curves but even that is rare. If you don’t mind listening to podcasts and spending lots of money on gas plus car maintenance it’s not bad! It works for me since I have a lot of friends up here in Portland and I like the city so much. If you don’t have ties to the city or its many amenities it’s probably not worth it.\n\nIf you do decide to do it make sure you get a safe, reliable, and high mpg car. Something like a Prius where you get close to 50mpg and won’t have to fix it a bunch. I started off doing it in a Subaru and spent about $500 a month on gas. Prius would be about $200. Also the winters can be wacky, the drive there is fine but the way back in the dark with heavy rain can be exhausting when you do it everyday	1	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.220568+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.220568+00	2025-04-27 18:33:03+00	f	mpcrij1

Honestly, it was very doable for me when I lived in SW Portland, in John’s Landing. It’s a straight shot down I5, for me less than 40 minutes in the morning and 50 minutes tops coming home in the afternoon (my place of work in Salem is directly off the Portland road exit). We moved to SE off of Powell a couple years ago, not quite as doable from this side of town and am looking for a job up here. \n\nI also lived in Salem before moving to SW 4 years ago, and I would say if you’re able to find something in SW Portland, the commute is well worth the opportunities of living in Portland over Salem.	1	\N	2025-04-28 00:17:04.22303+00	2025-04-28 00:17:04.22303+00	2025-04-27 19:09:15+00	f	mpcyj0h

Every little town I’d stop in, someone would end up asking where I was from. When they heard Portland, they’d essentially apologize.

All my good luck to you.\n\nThey’re crepuscular, so evening or early morning may be the best times to cross paths. If Simon is not familiar with the outdoors, you’re likely to find him very close to your place, but well hidden. They get spooked being without their usual environment and will likely hide. Check all the little crannies you can. Mine was found playing in a box literally the next building over, but was gone for days. He never responded to my calls, despite being a gregarious and social cat. If you have chill neighbors, maybe give them a heads up that you’ll be patrolling the ‘hood for a cat so they don’t call the cops on you (ask me how I know.) If you sit outside in the quieter times (we did this in the late evening) and just talk casually with someone, he may come to the sound of your voice. Leaving litter out seems to be advocated by some and not advocated by others. He may smell himself and come to it, but it can also attract other animals, which could serve to keep him away from it. That’s all the lost-cat brain dump I can recall at the moment, but I’ll come back if I remember more.\n\nHoping Simon is home ASAP! He’s a beautiful cat.	2	\N	2025-04-28 00:16:50.603816+00	2025-04-28 02:41:45.654937+00	2025-04-27 18:31:30+00	f	mpcr7x4

For years it's well known to be the biggest tourist trap in the state by many. Downtown is where you're supposed to go. However, it's only for tourists and employees from the suburbs. We actually have neighborhoods/districts where the real locals go. Honestly, the only real reason to go there is because of Powell's, Pioneer Square, and OMSI. Chinatown isn't what you think it is. It's not a real Chinatown. It's where our meth clinics are. Anything that used to be Chinese is ran down and closed except 2 things. People only say otherwise because we're desperate for people to go back. Downtown.

No pref coffee is really great and I do love me some Screen Door. Soro Soro is worth checking out too for the cute desserts. There's Laurelhurst theater which might be fun if you want to watch a movie while having some drinks in a historical movie theather.\n\nThere's a local music shop and if you head forward towards 32th, a cool record shop. 28th itself has great options going both north and south.

Tourists don't have to worry about a homeless encampment blocking the sidewalk in front of their house for months on end. Tourists don't have to deal with a school system that's ineffective and losing students to the suburbs, and facing massive cuts in the near future. Tourists don't have to worry about the near impossibility of building housing due to an insanely expensive and slow permitting system. Tourists don't have the worry about the some of the highest income taxes in the nation. Tourists don't have to worry about a police force that depending on who you ask, is either intentionally ineffective or severely under-resourced. \n\nPortland is a great city, and it's got tons of potential, but there are very real problems and people in these threads just post  "see everything is great here, any negativity is a lie" miss the mark.	6	\N	2025-04-28 00:16:42.453722+00	2025-04-28 05:54:45.436391+00	2025-04-27 22:51:27+00	f	mpe4itu

If you want to do it in two days, you put your bag on the truck going to the place where you want to stop for the night. If you’re not sure if you can do the full 200, bring a bag and put it on a truck for the stop you can definitely make it to.

I did it with a group of friends and our goal was to average 20 mph, which we achieved. \n\nI never focused on being in any specific zone for my STP training rides, and if I were to, it would definitely not be zone 4. It's more important to focus on increasing frequency and volume, ultimately increasing endurance.\n\nAssuming you have the time, I liked doing back to back long rides on weekends. Maybe you do a sixty mile group ride Saturday, on Sunday I would do another ride of equal or longer distance with some friends. But this is something you will have to scale up to, it can't be done just out of the gates.\n\nAt the end of the day, focus on riding more. Increase the number of days you ride and mileage. FWIW, I average 200mpw last time I did STP, that was more than enough. I'm sure my friends were closer to 125 to 150mpw. Don't worry about the zones so much.	3	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.709937+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.709937+00	2025-04-27 04:58:52+00	f	mp9lhjh

As someone who will be riding one day this year please go practice riding in a pace line so you can do it safely at the event. \n\nLast time I did stp in a day I averaged ~18.5 mph.

Reach the Beach\n2. Salem century (I can’t remember the name)\n3. Columbia county century challenge (the most climbing)\n\nIf you do these and then the STP you’ll be fine. It’s 5,000 ft over 200 miles. \n\nYou need to drink and eat early and often. \n\nDid it once, 18mph with husband. Glad I did it but won’t do it again\n\nAlso, pro move: Have a bike friend meet you in St Helens and pull you in to Portland. Fresh legs against a headwind and the dirty 30 is always the way to go.	3	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.726146+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.726146+00	2025-04-27 05:31:26+00	f	mp9p54z

But, a few ideas: \n\nAbsolutely best advice I can give is get an indoor smart trainer and sign up for TrainerRoad or Xert or one of the other coaching programs. There is just enough time to get you ready. I almost exclusively train indoors for centuries and other endurance rides. But, that’s also a lot less fun than being outside. \n\nBeside that: \n\n16.2 average for 60 miles is a good starting place! You have time to get ready, but it’s going to be a not fun day. \n\nDrafting/pace lines make a HUGE difference. But you can’t just do them. Your inexperience will be identified quickly. Unless you find a patient group to let you learn on the fly. It does happen, but it’s more likely you will piss people off or be dangerous to them. \n\nI’d suggest you think about your training differently. Intensity is a tool, use it, but don’t abuse it. It burns you out fast, both during a ride and as it accumulates over the weeks. If your weekends are your opportunity, I’d do 60-90 minutes of intensity on Saturday and something much longer and slower on Sunday. Maybe add ten miles a week every Sunday. But it shouldn’t be a race. Log good, solid, miles, methodically.\n\nIf you can pull it off, an hour of intensity during the week and an hour or two of something like zone two on another day would be ideal. You need saddle time to get your ass ready to be on a bike seat for 12 hours. \n\nTrack your miles. Over let’s say four to five weeks your weekly total should be going up. After those four to five, take a recovery week. And then get back at it until a week before STP and use that as a recovery week.\n\nThere are good podcasts about fueling and hydration. I’d start looking for those. \n\nCycling is the best because all you really need is determination. Good luck!!\n\nOh, you may also want to try an organized 100 mile ride before STP. It will be great training AND you can see if you like it enough to do something twice as long.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.733926+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.733926+00	2025-04-27 04:56:44+00	f	mp9l8lo

STP also generally has modest tail winds and modest grades for most of the route making it some of the lowest effort per mile riding.  All that said, it is still 200 miles, so get in some century days, practice eating and drinking properly.  Expect a lot of sun and heat, with 90’s being the norm for the last two years when I rode it.  Consider setting up your bike to handle eating and drinking on the bike such that you can skip some rest stops where it is easy to waste a lot of time.  I was stopping every 50 or so miles thanks to a frame bag with a couple of liters in a bladder and a ready supply of snacks.  I also wore a Da Brim to help with the sun load and would do the same if I rode it again.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.740323+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.740323+00	2025-04-27 07:45:04+00	f	mpa2r6q

I was in a similar spot to you when I did it in two days. I trained by commuting full time and then SPINNING from Pier Park to Troutdale, and back, every weekend for months. The two day was still very tough. I hit a wall just before Centralia. My wife and son were meeting me in our small camper van. I ate dinner with them at the carts provided by STP and saw all these really tiny people eating enormous meals. I just ate a normal portion and felt kind of nauseous afterwards. I went and chilled at the camper, which we parked in a spot where we could cheer on the late arrivals. After hanging for about 90 minutes I told my wife and son I was going for a second dinner. After round two the nausea went away and I started feeling good. Day two was a blast but it wouldn’t have been possible for me without a huge dinner and a full night of rest. I think it would have sucked to miss the overnight stop in Centralia and the party at the end in Portland on Sunday. Do it in two days. If it’s a gear issue there are solutions to that problem available.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.745609+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.745609+00	2025-04-27 15:16:27+00	f	mpbou7q

I recommend biking out to St. Helens and back, maybe with a friend, to get a better idea of your speed on flats. If you're stopping more than once an hour -- or drinking more than 2 bottles an hour -- that may be something to check into. As others have mentioned drafting saves you 30% or more watts. In a big pack, it's more. You should definitely practice. Pull through. Learn to ride with others. Learn the signals, etc. Also, and most importantly, get ready to embrace the suck.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:16:40.750776+00	2025-04-28 06:16:40.750776+00	2025-04-27 21:50:20+00	f	mpdtejz

First part of the trip you should go up into Astoria and down into cannon. Use 26 to comeback. I’d recommend after cannon going to manzanita. Tons of look outs on the way there. Then you take 53 from Nehalem to get to 26 and go back.

Just walking down Broadway street to the promenade is cute, classic tourist beach town vibes.\n\nThen I would recommend stopping at the pronto pup place in Rockaway beach. \n\nIn tillamook there is a place called blue heron French cheese company that is cuter than the tillamook cheese factory. The blue heron place has farm animals out front and multiple cute little stores/gift shops with fancy cheese, chocolate and snacks! \n\nIn Newport NYE beach, the aquarium, and the marine science center! Plus downtown Newport is fun to walk through as well, they have cute shops/restaurants and you can see the sea lions. \n\nBetween Newport and Waldport there is a restaurant called Luna sea fish house in Seal Rock which has really good food (a bit pricey though).	2	\N	2025-04-28 06:17:58.819207+00	2025-04-28 06:17:58.819207+00	2025-04-27 17:29:02+00	f	mpceqse

Lincoln City is fun but I'm biased since I live here. \n\nNorth of here like Rockaway Beach and Garibaldi are beautiful. Can't beat the views from the bay there. Go see Haystack rock. \n\nSouth of Lincoln City is also beautiful. Depoe Bay is amazing, Newport is about as coastal as it gets with its aquarium and maritime industry, and everything south of Newport is just as cool. \n\nThe WHOLE coast is amazing.

Pelican has several breweries along the way for certain, there are probably smaller operations mixed in as well, just not into the brewery scene as much anymore so don’t have any specific recs.

Hopefully this is to go to the aviation museum, it’s pretty incredible, that was our impetus for the reverse direction. \n\nYou should be able to get as far south as yachats which offers thors well, cape perpetua and other stuff.

Coastline - north or south coasts (further north is colder and windier but more rugged). Desert city with four season weather with trees and plateaus - Central Oregon (Bend, Redmond, Sisters). High desert with higher mountains - Eastern Oregon (La Grande, Pendleton, Burns). More greenery with more rain and more population - Willamette Valley (Portland, Salem, Eugene). Still green with more mountains and less population - Southern Oregon (Roseburg, Medford, Grants Pass)…. Plus, so many other amazing cities/towns (Crater Lake, Mt Hood, Mt Bachelor, Shakespeare Festival, Kite Festivals, rock hunting, gold panning, skiing, hiking, mountain biking……) and options to visit/live that would fill up books. If you go to the State of Oregon Visitor’s website, they have all kinds of videos and data of the state. It has pretty much anything you would want to know about. Hope that helps.

As far as passable, those 2 routes are not as maintained like you would expect a pass to be but they lay lava rock on the roads to help with traction. They pretty much leave it up to you if you can pass through here. Travel at your own risk. They will not stop you but yes it should be passable.

Nothing beats a hike on a hot day and plunging into the ice melt rivers that are like air conditioning running thru the mountains.

There was a really well dressed dude who was probably homeless, he looked older, like in his 50s or 60s, but still had dark hair. He had olive colored skin, and had a accent. He barely said anything other than "I love you" to people and he said as if it was a question "I love you?". He said it to all the people he would see, and people would say it right back. I'm not sure if he was neurodivergent, or if he didn't know much English or what his reasoning for saying it so much was, but he clearly had a lot of empathy and he was kind, he even offered me some candy one day and he liked giving people hugs.\n\nHe was so nice that I actually worried about him downtown, I knew that people got taken advantage of on the streets a lot, especially if they had a disability and this guy wasn't a big guy either, he could easily get snapped like a twig if someone decided to fuck with him, I really hope nothing bad happened to him.	1	\N	2025-04-28 06:28:23.953062+00	2025-04-28 06:28:23.953062+00	2025-04-28 06:05:04+00	f	mpfw0zu

If they’re not providing you with all the amenities listed in your lease, you can withhold rent after serving them with a certain notice usually that’s just a wake up. To the property management company to get their butt gear and fix what you need done.  Most companies do not want to deal with any of that. They’d probably just find you a storage unit.

Call the main line in Salem if you need any help. \n\nIf it’s an out of state car you will also need a VIN inspection and the DEQ can also do that. \n\nYou shouldn’t need to go into an office at all.   We just titled and registered an out of state car with a rebuilt titled and did it by mail. \n\nI ended up having to go into an office because someone made a mistake on the paperwork somewhere.

Hello last night I just found out that me and my grandma have an eviction notice and are supposed to be out by the 23rd of next month. This is the most scared I’ve been and I genuinely have no clue what to do. Some things to note: I started a gofundme and made a few tiktoks to try and promote it but nothing more than a few hundred views. My grandma is not employed (since 2020) her mom died and is dealing with major depression and a drug addiction. I am employed but due to poor scheduling I’ve been scheduled once a week for the past month. I have 2k in savings. No drivers license. No diploma. Not many options housing wise, just my mom but I would only go to her as a last resort (untreated bipolar/schizophrenia). I don’t have much real world experience. I don’t want to leave my grandma all alone either but I feel like it might have to be the case. I have about 7 cats to also worry about if we don’t figure out a solution. The debt is almost 13k. That’s about all, sorry for such a shitty post. I’ll be willing to answer more questions if needed, I’m struggling with a lot right now, even considered ending it all last night. Words of advice, resources or any stories of your own would help. Thank you for even reading this.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1jo3qrq/19_with_an_eviction_notice_what_to_do/	97	49	/r/askportland/comments/1jo3qrq/19_with_an_eviction_notice_what_to_do/	2025-04-01 06:30:43.999353+00	2025-04-01 06:30:43.999353+00	2025-03-31 13:54:35+00	f	f	text	0	0	{00,bill,mail,testimony,just,amp,https,today,oregonlegislature,gov}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I don’t know how to write this without sounding dramatic, but everything’s fallen apart and I’m out of ideas.\n\nI moved to La Pine after my boyfriend Kevin died. He was the love of my life — my person — and losing him wrecked me. We had two cats together, and now it’s just me and Dax. He was Kevin’s baby. I already had to give our other cat away and I can’t do that to Dax. He’s all I have left of our little family.\n\nI ended up in Oregon because I had nowhere else to go. I’m staying with my dad and his girlfriend, and it’s been constant fighting, yelling, meth use — I don’t feel safe here, and honestly I don’t think I’m okay anymore. I’m not working. I don’t have money. I don’t have friends here. I don’t have anyone in the whole state, really. I’m queer and grieving and losing my grip on everything, including myself.\n\nI need help. I need somewhere safe to go — even short-term — where Dax and I can breathe. Somewhere queer-friendly. Somewhere I don’t have to hide my grief or who I am. I can trade work, cleaning, house-sitting, pet-sitting — anything. I’m an artist too — I paint and customize furniture, weird little pieces, memorial stuff. I’m willing to do whatever it takes.\n\nIf you know of anyone — even outside Portland — who has a room, a cabin, a guest house, a corner of a safe place… please message me. Or just say hi. I’m trying to hold on, but I can’t do this completely alone.\n\nThanks for reading.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1jvxz4b/im_lost_in_oregon_after_my_partner_died_just/	301	38	/r/askportland/comments/1jvxz4b/im_lost_in_oregon_after_my_partner_died_just/	2025-04-11 03:33:18.784929+00	2025-04-12 01:09:12.495742+00	2025-04-10 13:31:23+00	f	f	text	377	3	{dog,yard,water,one,put,park,per,whoever,tiny,rest}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I realize this place may be long gone...\n\nI've lived in OR for 10+ years (in the Gorge), but before we moved here from out of state, I came to scope out Portland on a week long vacation. This would have been around 2013, give or take half a year. On that trip, we ate at a restaurant somewhere in the NW quadrant (not a NW neighborhood, the wider NW quadrant) that I'd love to track down if it still exists.\n\nIt would have been showing up on a lot of Portland's best-of lists at the time, since everywhere we went was pretty heavily researched. Wouldn't have been an obscure spot. What I remember most about it is that it was in more of a hilly, forested natural area, not an urban neighborhood. More like the feel around the zoo, Forest Park, Pittock Mansion. It may have been a suburb, but I don't think it was a very far drive (we were staying NE). We sat on a patio with an outdoorsy view, which may or may not have been enclosed. The menu had seafood, probably not strictly seafood, more like your standard PNW fare. Not fine dining, not fancy, but nice. Very good food. The building may have been a house at one point, had a homey feel, not industrial or modern.\n\nSince we live in the Gorge, I'm still a tourist in Portland. I come into the city often on weekenders to explore, but my memory is totally failing me about where this place might have been. Anyone have guesses?\n\nUpdate - SOLVED. I'm almost positive we were in the sunroom at Seasons &amp; Regions.	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9bq62/help_identify_a_restaurant_i_went_to_10_years_ago/	24	54	/r/askportland/comments/1k9bq62/help_identify_a_restaurant_i_went_to_10_years_ago/	2025-04-28 02:12:43.869143+00	2025-04-28 06:29:40.873686+00	2025-04-27 19:06:24+00	f	f	text	132	18	{not,nw,may,portland,10,went,years,long,quadrant,neighborhood}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I am a little newer to Portland, moved here in 2022. I'm curious if there is a law in place limiting maximum concert volume. I first got curious after my first few shows here because they just seemed overall quieter than I was expecting.\n\nAt one point, at Crystal Ballroom (pretty sure it was there, an Oh Sees show, I think?) I noticed a decibel meter display near the soundboard, which hovered very closely to 100 the entire time. I've since noticed that meter display at other venues and haven't seen anything above 100, really.\n\nThe clincher for me to even post this was Mogwai last night- it got to about 106 dB max, and only when I was in line with a speaker array. I have seen them elsewhere many times before and those shows blew my socks off. Not saying it was a bad show (Roseland Theater being awful aside), they are always good, just was hoping for just a bit more. I use the NIOSH sound level meter app and while that may not be terribly accurate (?), it has closely tracked with the meters I see in use at places.\n\nI love a very loud show from time to time, not ear-piercing but that stomach-rumbling presence that venue PAs can produce. I have been craving that and haven't yet been satisfied. I looked at the [city code for noise](https://www.portland.gov/code/18/all), but that seems to be about general neighborhood noise, etc, not anything specific to nightclubs/venues. \n\nWhat's going on here? Is someone out there looking out for me and my ears who I'll thank in 20 years? Is it some occupational rule for a safe workplace for the venue staff? (I'd support that, even if I wish my experience was different). Or a state or county regulation going on?\n\nI know in the past 10-15 years venues in many cities have gotten more serious about volume. I also record music and protecting my ears is important to me, but the sensory experience of feeling frozen in time from sheer volume is also quite special too (it doesn't need to be dangerous, decent earplugs can preserve the sound while keeping your ears safe). OR maybe I have gotten old and my ears and body aren't what they used to be. OR something. I dunno.\n\nCurious if there are any sound/venue staff or musicians here who can tell me if I'm onto something or if I'm making it all up. Just don't tell me that the Sunn O))) show here I missed had that brown note or whatever it is i'm looking for going on...	https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1k9d555/is_there_a_concertclub_maximum_decibel_ordinance/	2	21	/r/Portland/comments/1k9d555/is_there_a_concertclub_maximum_decibel_ordinance/	2025-04-28 05:55:44.75469+00	2025-04-28 06:29:40.873686+00	2025-04-27 20:07:04+00	f	f	text	44	42	{noise,show,time,not,portland,just,sound,going,ears,experience}	\N	\N	\N	\N

I am not asking you to trust me as an authority of 50501. In fact I am asking for you to turn your trust back towards your local organizations. 50501 in its original form was meant to be a call to action to the people by the people to support our constitutional governance. In the process of coordinating these protests, local communities within the states have formed strong relations that I have the utmost faith can coordinate the peoples future self advocacy. \n\nThe following are my suggestions to the community moving forward. \n\nAs a concept 50501 is not subject to ownership. The concept is that we all show up, at all 50 states, at each of the 50 state capitols in the solidarity of our support of our most basic human rights. \n\nNo one in this community has the authority to tell you what days you can or cannot protest as long as it is organized through the proper legal channels. \n\nNo one in this community has the right to tell you you don't have the authority to organize a protest as directed by the first amendment in the spirit of 50501. If you would like to form a community then do so. \n\nWe must participate in the democracy we wish to live in. This means our continued participation in elections, this means running for office on any level, this means civil discourse and exercising our first amendment rights. \n\n50501 does not win by outcompeting supportive movements. There are so many great communities already in place to find your voice and they need our support. \n\nWe must expect ourselves and our leaders to embody the ideals we wish for our society. This means remaining civil when we use our voice in our public spaces and when organizing we do so in a conscious and informed manner. If a leader does not act in accord with the core ideals of a society they are not representative of the will of the people and should not be followed. \n\n\nI believe that this is the best path forward if you agree, please share this message. \n\n\n\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/50501PDX/comments/1k9efyb/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	18	0	/r/50501PDX/comments/1k9efyb/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	2025-04-28 02:43:53.19896+00	2025-04-28 06:29:40.873686+00	2025-04-27 21:03:29+00	f	f	text	18	63	{50501,not,community,post,means,message,authority,people,support,50}	\N	\N	\N	\N

The other 48 people dispersed to other areas (and many of them cleaned mostly target shooting sites.  Our group got 2 areas, plus a disgusting old freezer full of rotten meat. YUK!

But now it's in great shape once again.  \n  \nElsewhere, a shot up abandoned pickup truck was dragged out to the roadway where DNR can get it hauled off (video in the comments on TNL's Facebook page).  Lots of stuff happened all over the forest yesterday and it was all good.  Still hearing about other's adventures.\n\nNext up is North Fork Wolf Creek shooting lanes, May 17th.

I am new to cycling got my bike last September and rode a lot until the weather got bad. Was feeling bold... Signed up for the 1 day STP with zero experience in cycling, group riding and so on... Since about the beginning of April I have been training aggressively on the weekends and casual riding during the week. Today I did my longest ride of 60 miles around Portland averaging 16.2 mph (Moving time). I know around town some of the areas are stop and go which kind of lowers your pace. But about 80% of the time I was in Zone 4 while pushing myself. By the end of it, my thighs were dead. I did have my snacks, water bottles I refilled multiple times at coffee shops with electrolytes. From the suggestions I have seen, people say to "pace yourself" How in the world is it even possible to average 17-20 mph while not destroying yourself. All recommendations I have seen is to be in Zone 2-3 most of the time riding STP. This borderline seems impossible??? If you are with a group and are drafting is it that much easier? I would like to train with someone out there who has at least some experience. I will continue on training hard on the weekends either way! Overall I think I will still do it! I will simply call my wife to pick me up if I feel I cannot finish but just looking for the best advice and also someone to ride with around Portland!

Good evening all!\n\nMy partner and I moved to Portland from Minneapolis about a month ago, and we are having a bizarre issue with our rental company (NMV Group — I’m not above naming and shaming). \n\nWhen we arrived, we were told that there were storage units on property. We didn’t expect this, as it wasn’t mentioned in our lease. However, our property manager told us (over email, so we have it in writing), that we had access to one, and that our normal key would open it up. Come to find out, not only does our key not work on any unit, but the storage unit we were told was ours is being used by another tenant.\n\nAfter figuring this out we emailed our manager back to figure out what unit we have access to. That was over a month ago, and we have received no response despite multiple emails and phone calls. We even drove to their office to try to talk to her in person, and we were not allowed in to speak to our manager. I have tried to look up contact info for anyone else in the building, but their website offers no additional info besides their main phone line, which we have already tried to call multiple times with no luck.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice for dealing with an unresponsive rental company? Most of the advice I’ve found has pertained to severe cases where units are nearly uninhabitable. I know that having access to a storage unit is not life or death, but it’s been extremely frustrating that I cannot get in contact with the person managing our property. \n\nThank you all in advance!\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/1k9j9lv/property_manager_is_ignoring_me_looking_for_advice/	8	14	/r/askportland/comments/1k9j9lv/property_manager_is_ignoring_me_looking_for_advice/	2025-04-28 06:28:57.587732+00	2025-04-28 06:29:40.873686+00	2025-04-28 00:54:29+00	f	f	text	36	46	{not,property,lease,unit,storage,manager,company,told,no,advice}	\N	\N	\N	\N

After the passing of my childhood cat last year who came all the way here with me, I have been missing that chair especially recently. Shipping it is incredibly expensive. The thing I'm wondering is, and I know it's so unlikely, is there anyone in this sub that will be moving, trucking, or anything to any where near North Carolina anytime in the next year? I will obviously pay, I just cannot afford the quotes I'm getting of $700+. And yes, I know $700 is probably cheap, I just cannot afford it, so I'm posting in a last ditch effort.

I am not asking you to trust me as an authority of 50501. In fact I am asking for you to turn your trust back towards your local organizations. 50501 in its original form was meant to be a call to action to the people by the people to support our constitutional governance. In the process of coordinating these protests, local communities within the states have formed strong relations that I have the utmost faith can coordinate the peoples future self advocacy. \n\nThe following are my suggestions to the community moving forward. \n\nAs a concept 50501 is not subject to ownership. The concept is that we all show up, at all 50 states, at each of the 50 state capitols in the solidarity of our support of our most basic human rights. \n\nNo one in this community has the authority to tell you what days you can or cannot protest as long as it is organized through the proper legal channels. \n\nNo one in this community has the right to tell you you don't have the authority to organize a protest as directed by the first amendment in the spirit of 50501. If you would like to form a community then do so. \n\nWe must participate in the democracy we wish to live in. This means our continued participation in elections, this means running for office on any level, this means civil discourse and exercising our first amendment rights. \n\n50501 does not win by outcompeting supportive movements. There are so many great communities already in place to find your voice and they need our support. \n\nWe must expect ourselves and our leaders to embody the ideals we wish for our society. This means remaining civil when we use our voice in our public spaces and when organizing we do so in a conscious and informed manner. If a leader does not act in accord with the core ideals of a society they are not representative of the will of the people and should not be followed. \n\n\nI believe that this is the best path forward if you agree, please share this message. \n\n\n\n\n	https://www.reddit.com/r/50501Portland/comments/1k9dh6k/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	22	0	/r/50501Portland/comments/1k9dh6k/follow_up_message_from_the_2nd_moderator_of_50501/	2025-04-28 06:22:36.418078+00	2025-04-28 06:29:40.873686+00	2025-04-27 20:21:23+00	f	f	text	22	55	{50501,not,community,post,means,message,authority,people,support,50}	\N	\N	\N	\N
